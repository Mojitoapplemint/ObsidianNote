I have been interested in math since middle school because I need to start thinking from "how to solve" the question, not simply memorizing knowledge and write them down. When I study math, I always try to understand something from very fundamental level because I don't want to accept it as it is and just memorize. One of my friend whose major is Computer Science recommended me to take Computer Science(comp-sci) course at university. Since I enjoy creating something never existed, also there are a lot of things in common between math and comp-sci, I decided to study comp-sci as well. My next concern was choosing the specific field in comp-sci because comp-sci is such a massive field that it is impossible to choose several field as a career. Thesedays, I start studying Deep Learning which is a specific type of Artifitial Intelligence. It is attractive field, especially when the performance of my model is 


To be honest, subject that JASSO program teaches is not my main interest. I am very excited due to unique experience that I can study with different people in different culture/environment. I believe that every single experience during the program will be unique and unfamiliar to me and I look forward to widen my overall perspective as I collaborate with my group mates to resolve the real world tasks. Furthermore, I consider this program as a great opportunity to experience Japanese culture.
