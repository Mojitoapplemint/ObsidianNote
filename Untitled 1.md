Since I haven't gotten any scholarship information yet, I can't say whether the amount is sufficient. However, I personally think that an adequet amount would be when the student doesn't have to pay any money while the student is staying at Japan.

Because I always value the oppertunity to get an unique experience more than money. If I can manage the total cost for the program by myself, I would apply without any hesistance.

Since my interest, math and computer science, is irrelevant to business as a field, knowledge that I will learn throughout the program might not be directly helpful for my study. However, I strongly believe that the whole experience during the program, collaborating with totally different people in totally different environment, will widen my view and strength various social skills.
