Suppose for Contradiction, let $n$ satisfies $\phi(n)=2p$. Let $n=p_1^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\dots p_{k}^{a_{k}}$ be prime factorization. Then, by Theorem 7.1 and Theorem 7.3, 
$$\phi(n)=p_{1}^{a_{1}-1}(p_{1}-1)\cdot p_{2}^{a_{2}-1}(p_{2}-1)\cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}-1}(p_{k}-1)$$

i) if $p\text{ }|\not\text{ }n$
Observe that $p\neq 2$ since $p \equiv 1\text{ (mod }3)$, then $p$ is odd. Since $p_{i}-1$
