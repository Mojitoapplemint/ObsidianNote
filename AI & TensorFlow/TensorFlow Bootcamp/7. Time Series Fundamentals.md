# What is Time Series Problem?
Time Series Problems deal with data *over time*
- Usually supervised learning is used

Classification
- Anomaly detection, time series identification
- Where did thi time series come from
- Discrete output (a label)

Forecasting
- Ex) Predict stock market prices
- Continuous output (a number)

## What Can Be Forecasted?
The predictability of an event or an quantity depends on several factors including:
- How well we understand the factors tatconbute to it
- How much data is available
- How similar the future is to the past
- *Whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast*

# Inputs and Outputs
For time serises problems, data is formatted in windows and horizons
- **Window:** The number of timesteps being used to predict the horizon
- **Horizon:** The number of timesteps into thefuture we want to predict
	- Predict next day: 1
	- Next week: 7
