# What is Time Series Problem(TSP)?
Time Series Problems deal with data *over time*
- Usually supervised learning is used

Classification
- Anomaly detection, time series identification
- Where did thi time series come from
- Discrete output (a label)

Forecasting
- Ex) Predict stock market prices
- Continuous output (a number)

## What Can Be Forecasted?
The predictability of an event or an quantity depends on several factors including:
- How well we understand the factors tatconbute to it
- How much data is available
- How similar the future is to the past
- *Whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast*

## Types(Patterns) of Time Series
1. Trend
	- Has clear increase or decrease (may or may not be linear)
2. Seasonal
	- Affected by seasonal factor, such as time of year
	- Similar behaviour happens again at *fixed/certain period*
3. Cyclic
	- Shows rises and falls over an *unfixed period*
	- Tend to be longer / more variable than seasonal patterns

## Univariate & Multivariate Data
Univariate
- Use only one variable for prediction
Multivariate
- Use more than one variable for prediction

# Inputs and Outputs
For time serises problems, data is formatted in windows and horizons
- **Window:** The number of timesteps being used to predict the horizon
- **Horizon:** The number of timesteps into thefuture we want to predict
	- Predict next day: 1
	- Next week: 7

**Seasonality**
- Number of samples per year

| TimeFrame | Seasonality |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Second    | 31,536,000  |
| Hour      | 8,760       |
| Day       | 365         |
| Week      | 52          |
| Month     | 12          |
- Time series data often has smaller number of samples

## Splitting Input Into Train and Test set
![[Pasted image 20240707132529.png]]
`train_test_split` in `sklearn` does not suit for TSP due to its randomness of sampling
- The *historical trend/pattern is necessary* for TSP model, thus we need to divide train and test set **at a certain moment**

# Common Evaluate Metrics
[Additonal Document](https://otexts.com/fpp3/accuracy.html)

Since we are predicting a number, this can be form of regression problem, thus we need regression-like metrics
- [[Evaluation Metrics#MAE|MAE]]: Mean Absolute Error
- [[Evaluation Metrics#MSE Mean Squared Error|MSE]]: Mean Squared Error

Other Time-Series Forecasting evaluation metrics
- [[Evaluation Metrics#RMSE Root Mean Squared Error|RMSE]]: Root Mean Squared Error
- [[Evaluation Metrics#MAPE Mean Absolute Percentage Error|MAPE]]: Mean Absolute Percentrage Error
- [[Evaluation Metrics#MASE Mean Absolute Scaled Error|MASE]]: Mean Absolute Scaled Error
