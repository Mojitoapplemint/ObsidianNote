# What is Time Series Problem?
Time Series Problems deal with data *over time*
- Usually supervised learning is used

Classification
- Anomaly detection, time series identification
- Where did thi time series come from
- Discrete output (a label)

Forecasting
- Ex) Predict stock market prices
- Continuous output (a number)

## What Can Be Forecasted?
The predictability of an event or an quantity depends on several factors including:
- How well we understand the factors tatconbute to it
- How much data is available
- How similar the future is to the past
- *Whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast*

## Types(Patterns) of Time Series
1. Trend
	- Has clear increase or decrease (may or may not be linear)
2. Seasonal
	- Affected by seasonal factor, such as time of year
	- Similar behaviour happens again at *fixed/certain period*
3. Cyclic
	- Shows rises and falls over an *unfixed period*
	- Tend to be longer / more variable than seasonal patterns

## Univariate & Multivariate Data
Univariate
- Use only one variable for prediction
Multivariate
- Use more than one variable for prediction

# Inputs and Outputs
For time serises problems, data is formatted in windows and horizons
- **Window:** The number of timesteps being used to predict the horizon
- **Horizon:** The number of timesteps into thefuture we want to predict
	- Predict next day: 1
	- Next week: 7

**Seasonality**
- Number of samples per year

| TimeFrame | Seasonality |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Second    | 31,536,000  |
| Hour      | 8,760       |
| Day       | 365         |
| Week      | 52          |
| Month     | 12          |
- Time series data often has smaller number of samples
