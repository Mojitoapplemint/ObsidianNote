| Hyperparameter        | What does it do?                                                  | Typical values                                                                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Input Images          | Target images you'd like to discover patterns in                  | Whatever you can take a photo of                                              |
| Input Layers          | Takes in target images and preprocesses them for further layers   | `input_shape = (batch_size, height, width, colour_channels)`                  |
| Convolutional Layers  | Extracts/learns the most importnat features from target images    | Multiple, can create with `tf.keras.layers.ConvXD (X can be multiple values)` |
| Hidden Activation     | Adds non-linearity to learned features                            | Usually [[Activation Functions#ReLU (Rectified Linear Units)\|ReLU]]          |
| Pooling Layer         | Reduces the dimensionality of learned image features              | Average (`tf.keras.layers.AvgPool2D`)or Max(`tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D`)      |
| Fully Connected Layer | Further refines learned features from convolutional layers        | `tf.keras.layers.Dense`                                                       |
| Output Layer          | Takes learned features and outputs them in shape of target labels | `output_shape=[# images]`                                                     |
| Output Activation     | Adds non-linearities to output layer                              | [[Activation Functions#Sigmoid\|Sigmoid]] or Softmax<br>                      |
