# Features and Labels
*"Can be varied depends on the problem"*

**Features**
- Photo `=>` Combination of width, height and colour channels(RGB)
	- Shape = `[batch_size, width, height, colour_channels]`
	- `None` for arbitrary batch_size, and `32` for common use

**Label**
- Shape = a vector that has the elements of `Number of classes`

# Hyperparameter
| Hyperparameter           | Binary Classification                          | Multiclass/MultiLabel Classification |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Input layer shape        | Same shape as number of features               | =                                    |
| Hidden layer(s)          | Problem specific, minimum=1, maximum=unlimited | =                                    |
| Neurons per hidden layer | Problem specific; generally 10 to 100          | =                                    |
| Output layer shape       | 1 (One class or the other)                     | one  per class                       |
| Hidden Activation        | Usually `ReLU` (Rectified linear unit)         | =                                    |
| Output Activation        | `Sigmoid`                                      | `Softmax`                            |
| Loss Function            | Binary Cross Entropy                           | Categorical Cross Entropy            |
| Optimizer                | SGD, Adam                                      | =                                    |
| Metrics                  | Classification Accuracy                        |                                      |
