A vector in the direction of the steepest increase of the function at certain points, where function referred to **loss function** in DL
- The gradients of the loss function with respect to the paramters of the NN *indicate the direction in which the parameters should be adjust to reduce the loss*

# Gradient Descent
The optimization algorithm commonly used to update the parameters of the network based on the gradients of the loss function
- Iteratively mode the parameters in the direction opposite to the gradient to minimize the loss
