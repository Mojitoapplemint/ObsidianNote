# Recurrent Neural Network

| Hyperparameter           | Functionality                                                                             | Ty  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Input layers             | Takes in target sequence                                                                  |     |
| Text Vectorization Layer | Maps input sequence to numbers                                                            |     |
| Embedding                | Turns mapping of text vectors to embedding matrix(**represeneation of how words relate**) |     |
| RNN cells                | FFind patterns in sequences                                                               |     |
| Hidden activation        | Adds non-linearity to learned features                                                    |     |
| Pooling later            | Reduces the dimensionality of learned sequence features                                   |     |
| Fully connected layer    | Further refines learned features from recurrent layer                                     |     |
| Output layer             | Takes learned featuyres and oiutputs them in shape of target labels                       |     |
| Output activation        | Adds non-linearities to output layer                                                      |     |
