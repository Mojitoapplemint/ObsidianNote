# What is Transfer Learning?
Technique that brings existing model's architecture and apply it to our own problem

## Why use Transfer Learning
- Can use proved architecture
- Can use working architecture which has already leanred patterns

## Types
`As is`
- Using an existing model with *no changes* what so ever
`Feature Extraction`
- Use the prelearned patterns of an existing model and *adjust the output layer* for own problem
`Fine-tuning`
- Use the prelearned patterns of an existing model and *"fine-tune" many or all of the underlying layers*, including output layers
- Usually requires more data than feature extraction

# Fine-Tuning
**Steps**
1. Create base model with `tf.keras.applications`
	- With `include_top=False`
2. Freeze the base model
3. Create inputs into model
4. Normalize inputs (If necessary)
5. Pass the input
6. Average pool the outputs of the base model
7. Create the output activation layers
8. Combine the inputs wityh the outputs into a model

Then compile and fit
