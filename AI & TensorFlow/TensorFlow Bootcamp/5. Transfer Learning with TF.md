# What is Transfer Learning?
Technique that brings existing model's architecture and apply it to our own problem

## Why use Transfer Learning
- Can use proved architecture
- Can use working architecture which has already leanred patterns

## Types
`As is`
- Using an existing model with *no changes* what so ever
`Feature Extraction`
- Use the prelearned patterns of an existing model and *adjust the output layer* for own problem
`Fine-tuning`
- Use the prelearned patterns of an existing model and *"fine-tune" many or all of the underlying layers*, including output layers
