# What is Transfer Learning?
Technique that brings existing model's architecture and apply it to our own problem

## Why use Transfer Learning
- Can use proved architecture
- Can use working architecture which has already leanred patterns

## Types
`As is`
- Using an existing model with *no changes* what so ever
`Feature Extraction`
- Use the prelearned patterns of an existing model and *adjust the output layer* for own problem
`Fine-tuning`
- Use the prelearned patterns of an existing model and *"fine-tune" many or all of the underlying layers*, including output layers
- Usually requires more data than feature extraction

# Fine-Tuning
**Steps**
1. Create base model with `tf.keras.applications`
	- With `include_top=False`
2. Freeze the base model
3. Create inputs into model
4. Normalize inputs (If necessary)
5. Pass the input
6. Average pool the outputs of the base model
7. Create the output activation layers
8. Combine the inputs wityh the outputs into a model

Then compile and fit

```python
# 1. Create base model with tf.keras.applications 
base_model = tf.keras.applications.efficientnet_v2.EfficientNetV2B0(include_top=False) 

# 2. Freeze the base model (so the pre-learned patterns remain) 
base_model.trainable = False 
# 3. Create inputs into the base model 
inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3), name="input_layer") 
# 4. If using ResNet50V2, add this to speed up convergence, remove for EfficientNetV2 # x = tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.Rescaling(1./255)(inputs) 
# 5. Pass the inputs to the base_model 
x = base_model(inputs) # Check data shape after passing it to base_model print(f"Shape after base_model: {x.shape}") 
# 6. Average pool the outputs of the base model (aggregate all the most important information, reduce number of computations) 
x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(name="global_average_pooling_layer")(x) print(f"After GlobalAveragePooling2D(): {x.shape}") 
# 7. Create the output activation layer 
outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax", name="output_layer")(x) 
# 8. Combine the inputs with the outputs into a model 
model_0 = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
