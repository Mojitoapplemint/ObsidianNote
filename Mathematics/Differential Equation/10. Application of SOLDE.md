For the Force function
$$F=ma$$
$F$ may depend upon $t, y, y'$. Since $a=y''$, this can be written as
$$my'' = F(t,y,y')$$

Let $v=y', v'=y''$, then
$$mv' = F(t,v)$$

Then, from the IC, we can integrate $v$ to obtain $y$

# Conservation of $E$
$$\sum F = (\text{constant})$$
- Let sum of all possible force is constant
- Thus, derivative of this will be 0
- Establish SOLDE
