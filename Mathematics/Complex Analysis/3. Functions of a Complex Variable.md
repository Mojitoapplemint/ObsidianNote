# Recall
A function from a set $A$ to a set $B$ written as $f:A\to B$ is a **rule** that assigns to every element in $A$, some *unique* element of $B$
- If $f(a) =b$, we call $b$ the image of $a$ under $f$
- The set $A$(the set of possible inputs to $f$ is called domain
- The set $B$(the set of all possible output) is called image/range
	- If $u \subseteq A$, write $f(u) = \{f(a)|a\in u\}$, called the image of $u$(under $f$)

1-1
- $f(a) = f(b)$ only if $a=b$

# Function of Complex Variable
- Functions whose inputs and outputs are complex numbers
- Polynomial, rational functions, exponential all make sense for complex numbers and their conjugation $\bar{z}$
- Since complex numbers can be identified with a pair of real number, we can think of a function $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ as a pair of $\mathbb{R}$-value functions on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ 
	- $f(z) = u(z)+iv(z) = u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$

## Example
Let $f(z) = z^2+2z$
$$f(x+yi) = (x+iy)^{2}+2(x+iy)= (x^2+2ixy-y^2)+2x+2iy$$
$$= (x^2-y^2+2x)+i(2y+2xy)$$

### $z \longmapsto iz$
- Rotate $90\degree$ counter-clockwise
![[Pasted image 20240127171933.png|350]]

### $z\longmapsto c\cdot z$
Let $w = |w|\cdot e^{i\phi}$
$wz = |w|e^{i\phi}\cdot |z|e^{i\theta}$
$=|w|\cdot|z| \cdot e^{i(\phi+\theta)}$
$\to$ scale by $|w|$ & rotate by $\phi$

### $z\longmapsto z^2$
$re^{i\theta} \longmapsto r^2e^{i\cdot2\theta}$
$\to$ Square moduli and double the argument
Take some subsets and visualize it
![[Pasted image 20240127174504.png]]
### $z \longmapsto z^n$
$|z^{n|}= |z|^n$
$\to$ $n^{th}$ square of moduli + argument multiplied by $n$

### $z \longmapsto \frac{1}{z}$
$re^{i\theta} \longmapsto \frac{1}{r} e^{-i\theta}$
- Interchange outside of unit circle with inside
- Flip across $Re$ axis

## Stereographic Projection & Riemann Sphere
![[Pasted image 20240127182739.png]]
$$x=\frac{2Re(w)}{|w|^{2}+1} ,y=\frac{2Im(w)}{|w|^{2}+1},z=\frac{|w|^{2}-1}{|w|^{2}+1}$$
$$a=\frac{x}{{1-z}}, b=\frac{y}{{1-z}}$$

one to one corresponding between points in the plane and points on the sphere, except N(north pole)
- This way of visualizing $\mathbb{C}$ is called the Reimann Sphere

As $|w|\to\infty$, the corresponding point on the sphere gets closer and closer to $N$
- Define the extended complex number to be $\hat{\mathbb{C}} = \mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}$, $\mathbb{C}$ together with this extra "point at infinity"
- In $\mathbb{R}$, there are two infinities: $-\infty, \infty$
- In $\mathbb{C}$, a number can become unbounded "In any direction," rather than distinguish between all of them, we think of them as all being "The same at infinity"

If we write $z\to\infty$, we mean that $|z|\to \infty$, without specifying "in which direction"


*we can do complex mapping with rotating the reimann sphere itself*

# Limits and Continuity

*Limits and Continuity are essentially the same as for real-value functions of two real variables*
$$f(z) = u(x,y)+iv(x,y)\{x,y\in \mathbb{R}\}$$

## Limits
A sequence in $\mathbb{C}$ is just an infinite list of complex numbers: $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, \dots$

We say the sequence $\{z_{n}\}$ has the limit $L\in\mathbb{C}$ if, 
- informally, the terms of the sequence approach $L$ as $n$ gets larger

If some small distance $\epsilon$, eventually, the terms in the sequence are within distance $\epsilon$ of $L$
- Given $\epsilon$, there is some $N$ such that whenever $n>N$, $|z_{n}-L|<\epsilon$
- For every $\epsilon>0$, there exists $N$ such that whenever $n>N$, $|z_{n}-L|<\epsilon$
	- If there is such an $L$, sequence converges to $L$
	- Otherwise(there isn't such $L$), sequence diverges
### Example
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{i}{\sqrt{ n }} = 0 $$
Let $\epsilon>0$, and we want $N$ so that $n>N$

$$\big|\frac{i}{\sqrt{ n }}-0 \big|<\epsilon$$
$$|\frac{i}{\sqrt{n}}| = \frac{1}{\sqrt n}<\epsilon$$
$$\frac{1}{\epsilon}<\sqrt n \implies \frac{1}{\epsilon ^2}<n$$
Let $N<\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$, then $n>N$ $|z_{n}-L| =|\frac{i}{\sqrt{ n }}-0| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ n }}<\epsilon$

### Computation of limit
i) 
$$z_{n} = \frac{{1+in}}{{3+2n}}$$
$$\lim_{ n \to \infty } \frac{{1+in}}{{3+2n}} =\lim_{ n \to \infty } \frac{{\frac{1}{n}+i}}{{\frac{3}{n}+2}} =\frac{i}{2} $$
ii)
$$z_{n} = i^{n}\implies i, -1, -i, 1, i, \dots$$
- Limit DNE(diverges)

Let $f$ be a function defined on some neighbourhood of $z_{0}$, except possibly at $z_{0}$. 
- The limit of $f$ as $z$ approaches $z_{0}$ is $L$ is $f(z)$ is close to $L$ whenever $z$ is close to $z_{0}$(but not equal)
- More precisely, for any $\epsilon>0$ there is some $\delta>0$ such that $|f(z)-L|<\epsilon$ whenever $0<|z-z_{0}|<\delta$


Suppose $f$ is defined on a neighbourhood to $z_{0}$, Then $\lim_{ z \to z_{0} }f(z) = L$ iff $\lim_{ n \to \infty }f(z_{n}) = L$, for every sequence $\{z_{n}\}$ converges to $z_0$

## Properties
1. $z \to \infty$ iff $|z_{n}|\to 0$
	- $\lim_{ z \to z_0}f(z)=0$ iff $\lim_{ z \to z_0 }|f(z)|=0$
2. $z \to \infty$ iff $\bar{z}_{n}\to 0$
	- $\lim_{ z \to z_0}f(z)=0$ iff $\lim_{ z \to z_0 }|\bar{f(z)}|=0$

Suppose $z_{n}\to L$, $w_{n}\to M$ & $\lim_{ z \to z_0 }f(z)=A,\lim_{ z \to z_0 }g(z)=B$
- `Fact1` 
	- $(z_{n}+w_{n})\to L+M$
	- $\lim_{z \to z_{0}}f(z)+g(z) = A+B$

- `Fact2:`
	- $(z_{n}\cdot w_{n})\to L\cdot M$
	- $\lim_{z \to z_{0}}f(z)\cdot g(z) = AB$

- `Fact3:`
	- $\frac{z_{n}}{w_{n}}\to \frac{L}{M}$ ($M\neq 0$)
	- $\lim_{z \to z_{0}}\frac{f(z)}{g(z)} = \frac{A}{B}$($B\neq 0$)

- `Fact4:` Let $z_{n} = x_{n}+iy_{n}$, $L = E+iG$
	- $z_{n}\to L$ iff $x_{n}\to E$ and $y_n \to G$
	- $\lim_{z \to z_{0}}f(z)=L$ iff $\lim_{z \to z_{0}}u(z) = E$ & $\lim_{z \to z_{0}}v(z)=G$ 

# Continuity
Let $f$ be defined on a neighbourhood of $z_{0} \in \mathbb{C}$. A function $f$ is continuous at $z_{0}\in \mathbb{C}$ if $\lim_{ z \to z_{0} }f(z) = f(z_{0})$
- A function $f$ is continuous at $A\subseteq\mathbb{C}$ if it is continuous at every point at $A$

Fact 3 imply sum, difference , quotients of continuous function are continuous
- It is trivial to show that $\lim_{ z \to z_{0} }c = c$; almost as easy to show $\lim_{ z \to z_{0}}z = z_{0}$
	- Any polynomial is continuous everywhere; any rational function is continuous on its domain

## Example: $\lim_{ z \to 0 } \frac{\bar{z}}{z}$
Find
$$\lim_{ z \to 0 } \frac{\bar{z}}{z}$$
If $z = x \in \mathbb{R}$(Approaching along the real axis)
$$\lim_{ x \to 0} \frac{\bar{x}}{x} = \lim_{ x \to 0 }\frac{x}{x} =  1$$
If $z=iy, y\in \mathbb{R}$

$$\lim_{ y \to 0} \frac{\bar{iy}}{iy}  = \lim_{ y \to 0} \frac{-iy}{iy}  = -1$$

Two limits are different, limit DNE

## Limits at infinity
We say "$z_{0}\to \infty$ if $|z_{n}|\to \infty$" when for every $M>0$, there is some $N$ such that $n>N, |z_{n}|>M$
- $\lim_{z \to z_{0}}f(z)=\infty$ iff $\lim_{z \to z_{0}}|f(z)| = \infty$

If for every $M>0$, $\exists$ $\delta>0$ such that $|f(z)|>M$ whenever $0<|z-z_{0}|<\delta$

# Neighbourhood
A neighbourhood of a point $z_{0}\in \mathbb{C}$ is a (small) disc centred at $z_{0}$
- $\leftrightarrow$ an open set containing $z_{0}$
- A set of the form $|z-z_{0}|< \epsilon$

A neighbourhood of infinity is a set of the form $|z|>M$ for some $M>0$ 

Similar definition for $\lim_{ z \to \infty } f(z) = L$ 

$\forall \text{ }\epsilon>0$, $\exists \text{ } M$ such that $|f(z)-L|<\epsilon$ whenever $|z|>M$

In $\mathbb{R},$ we can write $\lim_{x \to \infty}e^{x}=\infty$ and $\lim_{x \to \infty}e^{-x}=0$

However, in $\mathbb{C}$, $\lim_{z \to \infty}e^{z}$ DNE because you get different things depends on *how you get there*
