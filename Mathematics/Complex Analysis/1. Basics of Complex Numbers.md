- A complex number is a number of the form $a+bi$, where $a,b\in R$ and $i^{2}= -1$ 

- Set of complex number is denoted in $C=\{a+bi | a,b \in R\}$,  

- Traditionally use $z,w$ for unknown complex number
	- $\zeta$(zeta) and $\xi$(xi) as well

- If we have $z=x+yi$, $x$ is called **real part**, and $y$ is called **imaginary part**
	- $x=Re(z)$ & $y=Im(z)$
	- Thus, $z=Re(z)+Im(z)$
	- And $z=w$ iff $Re(z) = Re(w), Im(z) = Im(w)$

# Arithmetic Calculation

$C$ forms a field, which means we can do all those basic arithmetic operations

Addition and Multiplication
- Arithmetic is just like for real number, with the proviso of that $i^{2}= -1$ 
	- $(2+3i)+(1-i) = 3+2i$
	- $(2+3i)(1-i)=2+3i-2i-3i^{2} = 5+i$

Division
- How to calculate $\frac{2-i}{1+2i}$?
- Multiplying **conjugate of the denominator** to both denominator and numerator
$$\frac{2-i}{1+2i} = \frac{2-i}{1+2i}\cdot\frac{1-2i}{1-2i} = \frac{-5i}{1+4} = -i$$

# Geometric Picture

- Real number can be expressed on single number line, but complex number can't

- Since complex number is written as sum of real part and imaginary part, we can use them as coordinates and express $z$ in $R^2$
	- For $z=x+yi$, we can locate it in $(x,y)$ in $R^2$ plane

- Let $z=x+yi$ and $w=a+bi$, $z+w = (x+a)+(y+b)i$, which is just an vector addition

# Complex Conjugation

- If $z=x+iy$, its complex conjugate is $\bar{z}=x-yi$
	- Flipping sign of imaginary part
	- $z \in R$ iff $\bar{z} = z$
	- $z\in iR$ iff $\bar{z} = -z$
	- 
- Basic computation
	- $\overline{z+w} = \bar{z}+\bar{w}$
	- $\overline{zw} = \bar{z}\cdot \bar{w}$
	- $\bar{\bar{z}} = z$
	- $z+\bar{z} =2\cdot Re(z)$
	- if $z=x+yi$, $z\cdot\bar{z} = x^2+y^2$
		- This is real and non negative
		- Only 0 if $z=0$

# Absolute Value

Given $z=a+bi$, its absolute value of modulus is 
$$|z| = \sqrt{ a^{2}+b^{2}} = \sqrt{ z\cdot \bar{z}  }$$
- This will be $\geq 0$, and equal to 0 iff $z=0$
- Note that if $z$ is real, then $|z| = \sqrt{ a^{2}} = a$
- And this is gonna be length of vector $(a,b)$

## One properties of absolute value
$|zw| = |z|\cdot|w|$
- $|zw| = \sqrt{ (zw)(\bar{zw}) } = \sqrt{ z\bar{z}\cdot w \bar{w} } = \sqrt{  z\bar{z}}\cdot \sqrt{w \bar{w}} = |z|\cdot|w|$

Triangular inequality
- $|z+w| \leq|z|+|w|$
- $\rightarrow |z_{1}-z_{2}|\leq|z_{1}-w|+|z_{2}-w|$

# Polar Coordinates
Notice that $|z|$ corresponds to the polar coordinate $r$ of the point corresponds to $z$
- We define the argument of $z, arg(z)$ to be $\theta$ coordinate
![[Pasted image 20240110115310.png|300]]
$$z=x+yi = r\cos \theta+ir\sin \theta = r(\cos \theta+i\sin \theta)$$

![[Pasted image 20240112155425.png|300]]
Multiply two complex number, **multiply the moduli**(absolute values) and **add the arguments**
- $z = r(\cos \theta +i\sin \theta)$
- $w = s(\cos \phi +i\sin \phi)$ 

$$zw = r(\cos \theta+i\sin \theta)\cdot s(\cos \phi +i\sin \phi)$$
$$=rs(\cos \theta \cos \phi-\sin \theta \sin \phi)+i(\sin \theta \cos \phi+\sin \phi \cos \theta))$$
$$=rs(\cos(\theta+\phi)+i\sin(\theta+\phi))$$

# Exponential(Euler's Formula)

Since $a^{x}= e^{x\ln a}$, we might be able to express $e^{it}$
We are using power series representation of the exponential function
$$e^{x}=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3!}\dots= \sum^{\inf}_{n=0} {\frac{x^n}{n!}}$$
$$e^{it} = 1+it+\frac{(it)^2}{2}+\frac{(it)^3}{3!}+\frac{(it)^4}{4!}+\frac{(it)^5}{5!}\dots$$
$$=1+it-\frac{t^2}{2}-\frac{it^3}{3!}+\frac{t^4}{4!}+\frac{it^5}{5!}-\frac{t^6}{6!}\dots$$
$$=\left(  1-\frac{t^2}{2}+\frac{t^4}{4!}-\frac{t^6}{6!}+\frac{t^8}{8!}\dots \right)+\left( t-\frac{t^3}{3!}+\frac{t^5}{5!}-\frac{t^7}{7!}+\frac{t^9}{9!}\dots \right)i$$
$$=\cos t+i\cdot\sin t$$
- We can define $e^{it} = \cos t+i\cdot \sin t$
- This is called Euler's Formula

## With Polar Coordinate
And we can use this to Polar Coordinates
$z = r(\cos\theta+i \sin{\theta}) = r\cdot e^{i\theta}$
$w = s(\cos\phi +i \sin \phi) = s\cdot e^{i\phi}$
 Thus, $zw = rs\cdot e^{i(\theta+\phi)}$

Notice that for any real number $t$, $|e^{it}| = 1$
![[Pasted image 20240110120731.png|200]]
$e^{it}$ is on unit circle with angle $t$
Let $f(t) = e^{it}$, then this function travels on the unit circle endlessly

$S^1 = \{z\in C$ $|$ $|z|=1\}$ is unit circle
- $e^{i\theta}\in S^1$ for any $\theta \in R$
- If $z,w\in S^1$, then their product $zw$ is also in $S^1$
- $zw = rs\cdot e^{i(\theta+\phi)}$, the angle of $zw$ is just an addition $\theta+\phi$
![[Pasted image 20240112161123.png|300]]

![[Pasted image 20240112202616.png|150]]
- Define $e^{x+iy} = e^xe^{iy}$ Then $e^{z+w} = e^ze^w$ for any $z,w\in C$
- Still true that $e^z\neq 0$ for all $z\in C$
- Complex exponential function is periodic with period $2\pi i$ that is $e^{z+2\pi i} = e^z$

### Example
Calculate $(1+i)^{24}$
![[Pasted image 20240113142639.png|350]]
$$1+i = \sqrt{ 2 }e^{i \pi/4}$$
$$\rightarrow (1+i)^{24} = (\sqrt{ 2 }e^{i \pi/4})^{24}$$
$$=2^{12}e^{6\pi i} = 2^{12}$$

## Magnitude and Phase

 $z=r\cdot e^{i\theta} = |z|\cdot e^{ie}$
 - $|z|$ is real number, called **Magnitude**
 - $e^{i\theta}$ has absolute value of 1, called **Phase**
![[Pasted image 20240113131219.png|300]]

# Roots of Unity
Consider solving the equation $$z^{8}= 1$$
In polar form, Let $z = \mathrm{re}^{i\theta}$, so the equation is $r^{8}e^{8i\theta}= 1$
- This implies that $r=1$ since $r\geq1$

Then when $e^{8i\theta} = 1$?
- Only when $8\theta=2\pi k, k\in Z$ $\theta = \frac{2\pi}{8}k$
- So solutions are $e^{\frac{2\pi i}{8}}, e^{2\cdot\frac{2\pi i}{8}}, e^{3\cdot\frac{2\pi i}{8}}\dots , e^{8\cdot\frac{2\pi i}{8}} = 1$

![[Pasted image 20240113143636.png|300]]

More generally, the equation
$$z^{n}= 1$$ has $n$ solutions
$$e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}}, e^{2\cdot\frac{2\pi i}{n}}, e^{3\cdot\frac{2\pi i}{n}}\dots e^{n\cdot\frac{2\pi i}{n}}=1$$
- The numbers $\{{e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}k}}, k=1,2,\dots n\}$ are called the $n^{th}$ roots of 1 or the $n^{th}$ roots of unity
- Let $\omega  = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}}$, then those roots are just $\omega_{n},\omega_{n}^{2}, \omega_{n}^{3}\dots, \omega_{n}^{n}=1$
- If $k$ is relatively prime to $n$ then $w_{n}^{k}$ is called a primitive $n^{th}$ root of 1
- In this case, $(\omega^{k}_{n})^{n}=1$ but no smaller power of $\omega^{k}_{n}$ equals 1

In general, for any fixed $w\in \mathbb{C}(w\neq 0)$ the equation $z^{n}= w$ has $n$ solutions
$\forall$ $n,w$
- $z_{0}$ is one solution, then $z_{0}\omega_{n}, z_{0}\omega_{n}^{2}, z_{0}\omega_{n}^{3\dots,}z_{0}\omega_{n}^{n-1}$ are all distinct solutions

# Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

Let $p(z) = a_{0}+a_{1}z+a_{2}z^2+\dots+a_{n}z^n$ be polynomial with complex coefficients (i.e. all $a_{j}\in \mathbb{C}$). Then there is some(at least one) complex number $\alpha$ with $p(\alpha) = 0$ for some $\alpha\in\mathbb{C}$

**Corollary**: A polynomial with complex coefficients $p(z)$ can be written as the production of linear factors
$$p(z) = c(z-\alpha_{1})(z-\alpha_{2})\dots(z-\alpha_{n})$$
with $\alpha_{j} \in \mathbb{C}$ not necessarily distinct
## Proof
By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, $p(z)$ has a root $\alpha_{1}\in \mathbb{C}$. 
- $p(z)$ can be written as $p(z) = (z-\alpha_{1})q_{1}(z)$ for some polynomial $q_{1}(z)$ of degree $n-1$. 
- Applying the FTA to $q_{1}(z)$ yields a root of $q_{1}$, say $\alpha_{2}$, and gives a factorization $p(z) = (z-\alpha_{1})(z-\alpha_{2})q_{2}(z)$ for some polynomial $q_{2}(z)$ of degree $n-2$. 
- Continuing in this manner, this process must eventually stop when the degree of $q$ reaches zero. 

Thus, in order to find all roots of all polynomials with complex coeffiecients, of any degree, we do not need to go outside the set of complex numbers. We say that the set of complex numbers is *algebraically closed*
