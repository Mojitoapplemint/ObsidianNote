Involves an unknown function of **only one variable**

Model where the rate of change depends on time and the variable itself
$$y' = \frac{dy}{dt}$$
- Using prime(') notation
- Solution involving Anti-Derivative

### Examples 

For $P' = a\cdot P$
$$\frac{dP}{dt}=aP$$
$$ \frac{1}{P}dP = adt$$
- Make sure to **put only one variable each side**
$$\int \frac{1}{P} \, dP  = a\cdot\int 1 \, dt $$
$$\ln P+C_{1}=a\cdot t+C_{2}$$
- Using $C$ for arbitrary constant
$$\ln P=a\cdot t+C$$
$$P=e^{at+C}$$
$$P = D\cdot e^{at}$$
- When $D$ is arbitrary constant

$\rightarrow$ We can verify the solution by checking LHS=RHS
$$\frac{dP}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}\left(D\cdot e^{at} \right)$$
$$=D\cdot a\cdot e^{at}$$
$$=a\cdot D\cdot e^{at}$$
$$=a\cdot P = aP$$
## Solutions of Differential Equations
Solution of a differential equation is a function that satisfies the differential equation on **some open interval**
- Not function that satisfy on isolated points

$y$ is a solution if...
1. $y$ is n times differentiable
2. $y^{(n)}(x) = f(x,y(x),y'(x),\dots, y^{(n-1)}(x))$ for all $x$ in some open interval $(a,b)$
3. $y' = f(x,y(x))$

### General Solution
- Solution of the DE that contains arbitrary constant $c$
	- And $c$ is called parameter 

### Solution curves and Integral curves
Solution Curves
- Graph of solution of differential equation for open interval
- Has to be **function**

Integral Curves
- A curve $C$ is said to be an integral curve of a differential equation if every function $y=y(x)$ whose graph is a segment of $C$ is a solution of the differential equation
- Integral curve consists of solution curve

Any solution curve is integral curve, but integral curve need not to be solution curve **because it may not be a function**

## Initial Value Problem

Steps
1. Solve Differential equation
	- Get General Solution
2. Plug a given values(Initial Condition) in the solution
3. Calculate for arbitrary constant $C$

- Number of initial condition required is the same with the order of the DE
	- Second order requires two conditions to get the actual answer
	- Ex) $y(a) = b, y'(a) = b'$

**Interval of Validity**
- The largest open interval that contains $x_{0}$(given points in initial condition) on which $y$ is defined and satisfies the DE is called interval of validity of $y$

# Linear First Order Equation

DE can be written as 
$$y'+p(x)y = f(x)$$
is called Linear First Order Equation 

If $p$ and $f$ are continuous on some open interval $(a,b)$ then there is unique formale $y=y(x,c)$ analogous to equation that involves $x$ and a parameter $c$
- For each fixed value of $c$, the resulting function of $x$ is a function of Equation on $(a,b)$
- if $y$ is a solution of Equation on $(a,b)$, then $y$ can be obtained from the formula by chooseing appropriate $c$

Homogenous and Trivial solution
- Equation is homogenous iff $f\equiv 0$
	- $y=0$ is obviously a solution, it is *trivial solution*
	- Otherwise, it is non-trivial solution
- Otherwise, it is non-homogenous

# Homogenous Equation

DE can be written as 
$$y'+p(x)y = 0$$
is called Linear First Order Equation 

Then, its general solution on the open interval $(a,b)$ is
 $$y=ce^{-P(x)}, $$
where $$P(x) = \int p(x) \, dx $$
is any antiderivative of $p$ on $(a,b)$; that is, 
$$P'(x) = p(x), a<x<b$$
- There is no arbitrary constant because it will eventually combined to the coefficient $c$ at $ce^{-P(x)}$

Steps
1. Find $p(x)$
2. Determine $P(x)$
3. Find $e^{-P(x)}$
4. Find $y=ce^{-P(x)}$

# Nonhomogeneous Equation
In homogenous equation
$$y'+p(x)y = f(x)$$
The homogenous equation
$$y'+p(x)y = 0$$
is called **complementary equation**

### Examples
$$y'+2y = x^3e^{-2x}$$
The complementary equation of this is
$$y'+2y =0$$

We are assuming the equation $y = uy_{1}$, $u=u(x)$ where $y_{1}$ is a nontrivial solution of the complementary equation
- This is called *Variation of Parameters*

### Logic behind
Let $y_{1}$ is the solution of the complementary equation, then
$$y_{1}'+p(x)y_{1} = 0$$

From $y=uy_{1}$, 
$$y' = u'y_{1}+uy_{1}'$$
Therefore,
$$y'+p(x)y = f(x)$$
$$\to u'y_{1}+uy_{1}'+p(x)(uy_{1}) = f(x)$$
$$\to u'y_{1}+u(y_{1}'+p(x)y_{1}) $$
$$= u'y_{1} = f(x)$$
$$u' = \frac{f(x)}{y_{1}}$$
### Steps
1. Solve for $y_{1}$
2. Assume the solution $y=uy_{1}$
3. Find $u' = \frac{f}{y_{1}}$
4. Find $u$
5. Find $y$
6. Then solve for Initial Condition
