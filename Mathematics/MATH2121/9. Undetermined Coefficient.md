# Method of Undetermined Coefficient
Consider
$$ay''+by'+cy=e^{\lambda x}G(x)$$
where $\alpha$ is constant and $G(x)$ is polynomial

For $y=y_{p}+c_{1}y_{1}+c_{2}y_{2}$, $c_{1}y_{1}+c_{2}y_{2}$ can be found by [[8. Constant Coefficient DE#General Solution|this]], let's figure how to find $y_{p}$.

## Case 1: 
If $e^{\alpha x}$ is *not a solution* of the complementary equation
$$y_{p} = e^{\lambda x}Q(x)$$
## Case 2:
If $e^{\alpha x}$ *is a* solution, but$xe^{\alpha x}$ *is not* 
$$y_{p} = xe^{\lambda x}Q(x)$$
## Case 3: 
Both $e^{\alpha x}$ and $xe^{\alpha x}$ are solution
$$y_{p} = x^{2}e^{\lambda x}Q(x)$$

Where $Q(x)$ is another polynomial with the same degree as $G$


## For $ay_{p}''+by_{p}'+cy_{p}=ke^{\lambda x}$
1. Find correct case    $y_{p}=Ae^{\lambda x} \text{ or } Axe^{\lambda x} \text{ or } Ax^{2}e^{\lambda x}$
2. Substitute $y_{p}$ to $ay_{p}''+by_{p}'+cy_{p}=ke^{\alpha x}$  and solve for $A$

## For $ay_{p}''+by_{p}'+cy_{p}=ke^{\lambda x}G(x)$
where $G(x)$ is a polynomial of degree greater than zero
- Use $y=ue^{\lambda x}$ substitution and get $au''+p'(\alpha)u'+p(\alpha)u=G(x)$
	- Where $p(\alpha) = a\alpha^{2}+b\alpha+c$ is characteristic polynomial

# Method of Undetermined Coefficient 2
$$ay''+by'+cy = e^{\lambda x}(P(x)\cos\omega x+Q(x)\sin \omega x)$$
where $\lambda, \omega$ are constant and $P(x), Q(x)$ are polynomials

## Forcing Function without exponential factors
Case 1)
Suppose $\omega$ is a positive number and $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials. Let $k$ be a larger degrees between $P$ and $Q$. Then, the equation
$$ay''+by'+cy=P(x)\cos \omega x+Q(x)\sin \omega x$$
has a particular solution
$$y_{p}=A(x)\cos \omega x+B(x)\sin \omega x$$
where $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ are $k^{th}$ order polynomials
- Both $\cos \omega x$ and $\sin \omega x$ **are not** the solutions of complementary equation

Case 2)
If the equation has the format of
$$a(y''+c_{1} y)=P(x)\cos \omega x+Q(x)\sin \omega x$$
Then, $\cos \omega x$ and $\sin \omega x$ **are** the solutions of complementary equation and DE will have a solution of
$$A(x) = A_{0}x+A_{1}x^{2}+\dots A_{k}x^{k+1}\text{ and }B(x)=B_{0}x+B_{1}x^{2}+\dots B_{k}x^{k+1}$$
### When $P$ and $Q$ are constant
For Case 1, let $A$ and $B$ are constant

For Case 2, we use particular solution of 
$$y_{p} = x(A \cos\omega x+B\sin\omega x)$$
1. Calculate $y_{p}'\text{ and }y_{p}''$ and substitute in DE
2. Simplify and express $P$ and $Q$ with respect to $A$ and $B$
3. Solve the system

## Forcing Function with exponential factors
$$ay''+by'+cy = e^{\lambda x}(P(x)\cos\omega x+Q(x)\sin \omega x)$$
Step)
1. Let $y_{p} = u\cdot e^{\lambda x}$ and plug this in in DE
2. This will give SOLDE with respect to $u$ and RHS become forcing function without exponential as $e^{\lambda x}$ cancels out
3. Follow step from above
