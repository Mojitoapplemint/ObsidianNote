Initial Value Problem
$$y'=f(x,y)\text{, }y(x_{0})=y_{0}$$
cannot be solved analytically
- Thus, we approximate the value using different method

- Divide the certain interval $[x_{0}, b]$ into $n$ equally spaced points, $x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}\dots x_{n}=b$, thus
$$x_{i} = x_{0}+ih \text{  }\{i=1,2,\dots n\}$$
where
$$h=\frac{b-x_{0}}{n}$$
is width of the each interval

Denote the approximated value of the solution at these points by $y_{1},y_{2}, \dots y_{n}$
- $y_{i}$ is approximated value of $y(x_{i})$

And we call $e_{i} = y(x_{i})-y_{i}$ as the **error** at the $i^{th}$ step
- From initial condition $y(x_{0}) = y_{0}$, $e_{0}=0$
- $e_{i}\neq 0$ if $i > 0$

Two types of error
- **Truncation Error**: Caused by inaccuracy of approximation
- Roundoff Error: Caused by Computer's inaccurate arithmetic

# Euler's Method
- Assuming that the tangent line to the integral curve of Equation at $(x_{i}, y(x_{i}))$ approximates the integral curve over the interval $[x_{i}, x_{i+1}]$
	- Linear Approximation
	- $y'=f(x_{i}, y(x_{i}))$

$$y_{i+1} = y_{i}+hf(x_{i}, y_{i}) \text{, }(0\leq i\leq n-1)$$

## Logic Behind
From concept of linear approximation,
$$y\approx y(x_{i})+f(x_{i}, y(x_{i}))(x-x_{i})$$
for $(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1})$, Let $x=x_{i+1} = x_{i}+h$
$$\implies y_{i+1} = y(x_{i})+hf(x_{i}, y(x_{i}))$$

Substitute $i=0$
$$y_{1} = y_{0}+hf(x_{0},y_{0})$$
$$y_{2}=y(x_{1})+hf(x_{1},y(x_{1}))$$
Since we don't know $y(x_{1})$, we use approximated value, $y_{1}\approx y(x_{1})$
$$y_{2}=y_{1}+hf(x_{1},y_{1})$$
Continue this process, 
$$y_{i+1} = y_{i}+hf(x_{i}, y_{i})$$
