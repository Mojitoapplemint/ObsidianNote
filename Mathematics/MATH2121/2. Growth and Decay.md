# Growth and Decay

# Exponential Model
Model that its rate of the change of a quantity $Q$ is proportional to $Q$
$$Q' = aQ$$
- Where $a$ is constant of proportionality
	- $a>0$: Exponential growth
	- $a<0$: Exponential decay

[[1. Ordinary Differential Equation#Examples|General Solution]] of $Q' = aQ$ is 
$$Q = ce^{at}$$
And [[1. Ordinary Differential Equation#Initial Value Problem|Initial Value Problem]]
$$Q' = aQ,Q(t_{0}) = Q_{0}$$
is
$$Q_{0}e^{a(t-t_{0})}$$
## Calculation
$$Q' = aQ,Q(t_{0}) = Q_{0}$$
$$\frac{dQ}{dt}= aQ$$
$$\frac{1}{Q}dQ = adt$$
$$lnQ = at+c$$
$$Q = e^{at+c}$$
$$Q = D e^{at}$$
From IC,
$$Q_{0} = De^{at_{0}} \longrightarrow D = Q_{0}e^{-at_{0}}$$
$$Q = D e^{at} = Q_{0}e^{-at_{0}} \cdot e^{at}$$
$$=Q_{0}e^{a(t-t_{0})}$$



## Radioactive decay
- Since it is decay, $a$ has to be negative, thus we are using another constant, $k$, which $a=-k(k>0)$ 
$$Q = Q_{0}e^{-k(t-t_{0})}$$

- The half-life is *independent* of $t_{0}$ and $Q_{0}$ , since it is determined by the properties of the material, not by the amount of the material present at any particular time

## Mixed Growth and Decay
- DE that grows and decays at the same time in each ratio
- From decay constant $k$, 
$$Q' = -kQ$$
- From growth constant $a$, 
$$Q' = aQ$$
- If either decay rate and growth rate is independent to the variable, then just add the constant
- Equilibrium: when times goes infinity(?)

### Example
$Q$ decreases proportionally its amount and increases at a constant rate of $a$
Then, 
$$Q' = -kQ+a$$
$$Q'+kQ =a$$
Since this is non-homogenuous system, we need to solve its complementary equation first, which is 
$$Q_{1}'+kQ_{1} = 0 \longrightarrow Q_{1} = Ce^{-kt}$$

Now assuming $Q=uQ_{1}$
$$u' = \frac{f(x)}{Q_{1}} = \frac{a}{Ce^{-kt}} = \frac{a}{C}e^{kt}$$
$$u=\frac{a}{Ck}e^{kt}+d$$
Therefore, 
$$Q=uQ_{1} = (\frac{a}{Ck}e^{kt}+d)(Ce^{kt})$$
$$=\frac{a}{k}+dCe^{-kt}$$
$$=\frac{a}{k}+he^{-kt}$$

## Compound interest and Continuous Compound
$$Q(t) = Q_{0}(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$$
- $r$: Interest rate
- $n$: Number of compound per year
- $Q_{0}$: Initial deposit

Continuous compound: when $n\to\infty$
$$\lim_{ n \to \infty } Q_{0}(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$$
