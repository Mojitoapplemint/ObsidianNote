Well defined relationship between two sets

**Ex)**
1. $<, >, \leq, \geq\dots$

2. Divisibility( "$|$" )
	- For $a$ and $b$, $a$ is divisible by $b$ ($b|a$) if $\exists \text{ }m\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $b\cdot m=a$

3. Subsets

**4.** Given sets $A$ and $B$, if $\alpha$ is any element of $A$ and $\beta$ is any element of $B$, a relation from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ **is subset of** $A\times B$
	- $R=\{(a,b)\in A\times B\text{ | (relation between }a,b)\}$
	- *Think of things in the subset as things in the relation
	  and things not in the ubset as things not in the relation*

5. Directly Specifying the exact subset is available
	- $A=\{a,b,c\}$, $B=\{x,y,z\}$
	  $R = \{(a,x), (b,x), (a,y), (c,z)\}$ is a valid relation since all ordered pair the in the relation are the element of $A\times B$

6. A relation on $A$ is a relation from $A\times A$

# Properties
## Reflective
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$, $R$ is reflective if 
$$\text{for all } x\in A, (x,x)\in R$$

## Symmetric
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$ and $a,b\in A$, $R$ is symmetric if 
$$\text{Whenever }(a,b)\in R, \text{then }(b,a)\text{ must be in } R$$

## Transitive
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$ and $a,b,c\in A$, $R$ is Transitive *if following statement is satisfied:*
$$\text{if }(a,b)\in R \text{ \& }(b,c)\in R, \text{ then }(a,c)\in R$$

## Anti-Symmetric
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$ and $a,b\in A$, $R$ is Anti-Symmetric *if following statement is satisfied:*
$$\text{if }(a,b)\in R \text{ \& }(b,a)\in R, \text{ then }a=b$$
- Meaning that $a=b$ has to be true

**Ex)**
$A=\text{Set of People}$
$R=\{(a,b)\in A\times A\text{ | } a\text{ and }b\text{ has the same height}\}$

This is not Anti-Symmetric
- If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are any two different people who have the same height, then $(\alpha, \beta)\in R$ and $(\beta, \alpha)\in R$, but $\alpha\neq\beta$ since **they are still different people**

# Ex) $R=\emptyset$
For relation $R$ on $A=\{a,b,c\}$, if $R=\emptyset$, then
- $R$ is Symmtric, Trainstive, and Anti-Symmtric

### Proof for Non-Reflectivity
Since $(a,a)\in\emptyset$ is false, $R$ is not Reflective

### Proof for Symmetricity
For Symmetric condition, 
$$\text{If }(a,b)\in \emptyset, \text{then }(b,a)\in \emptyset$$
Since the hypothesis( "$(a,b)\in \emptyset$" ) can't be true, the statement is true.
Thus, $R$ is Symmetric

### Proof for Transitivity
For Transitive condition,
$$\text{If }(a,b)\in \emptyset \text{ \& }(b,c)\in \emptyset, \text{ then }(a,c)\in \emptyset$$
Since the hypothesis( "$(a,b)\in \emptyset \text{ \& }(b,c)\in \emptyset$" ) can't be true, the entire statement is true.
Thus, $R$ is Transitive

### Proof for Anti-Symmetricity
For Anti-Symmetric condition,
$$\text{If }(a,b)\in R \text{ \& }(b,a)\in R, \text{ then }a=b$$
Since the hypothesis( "$(a,b)\in \emptyset \text{ \& }(a,b)\in \emptyset$" ) can't be true, the entire statement is true.

# Ex) Relation Satisfies All Properties 
For any set of $A$, the relation $R$,
$$R=\{(x,y)\in A\times A \text{ | }x=y\}$$

## Proof for Reflectivity
Consider $(\alpha, \alpha)$ which $\alpha$ is any element of $A$.
- Since any $\alpha\in A$ satistifes $\alpha=\alpha$

Thus, $R$ is Reflective

## Proof for Symmetricity
Consider $(\alpha, \beta)$ which $\alpha, \beta \in A$.
- From hypothesis of Symmetricity, $\alpha=\beta$
- Then, since $\alpha=\beta$, $\beta=\alpha$ is also true

Thus, $R$ is symmetric
