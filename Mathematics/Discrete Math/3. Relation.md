Well defined relationship between two sets

**Ex)**
1. $<, >, \leq, \geq\dots$

2. Divisibility( "$|$" )
	- For $a$ and $b$, $a$ is divisible by $b$ ($b|a$) if $\exists \text{ }m\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $b\cdot m=a$

3. Subsets

**4.** Given sets $A$ and $B$, if $\alpha$ is any element of $A$ and $\beta$ is any element of $B$, a relation from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ **is subset of** $A\times B$
	- $R=\{(a,b)\in A\times B\text{ | (relation between }a,b)\}$
	- *Think of things in the subset as things in the relation
	  and things not in the ubset as things not in the relation*

5. Directly Specifying the exact subset is available
	- $A=\{a,b,c\}$, $B=\{x,y,z\}$
	  $R = \{(a,x), (b,x), (a,y), (c,z)\}$ is a valid relation since all ordered pair the in the relation are the element of $A\times B$

6. A relation on $A$ is a relation from $A\times A$

# Properties
## Reflective
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$, $R$ is reflective if 
$$\text{for all } x\in A, (x,x)\in R$$

## Symmetric
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$ and $a,b\in A$, $R$ is symmetric if 
$$\text{Whenever }(a,b)\in R, \text{then }(b,a)\text{ must be in } R$$

## Transitive
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$ and $a,b,c\in A$, $R$ is Transitive *if following statement is satisfied:*
$$\text{if }(a,b)\in R \text{ \& }(b,c)\in R, \text{ then }(a,c)\in R$$

## Anti-Symmetric
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$ and $a,b\in A$, $R$ is Anti-Symmetric *if following statement is satisfied:*
$$\text{if }(a,b)\in R \text{ \& }(b,a)\in R, \text{ then }a=b$$
- Meaning that $a=b$ has to be true

**Ex)**
$A=\text{Set of People}$
$R=\{(a,b)\in A\times A\text{ | } a\text{ and }b\text{ has the same height}\}$

This is not Anti-Symmetric
- If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are any two different people who have the same height, then $(\alpha, \beta)\in R$ and $(\beta, \alpha)\in R$, but $\alpha\neq\beta$ since **they are still different people**

# Ex) $R=\emptyset$
For relation $R$ on $A=\{a,b,c\}$, if $R=\emptyset$, then
- $R$ is Symmtric, Trainstive, and Anti-Symmtric

### Proof for Non-Reflectivity
Since $(a,a)\in\emptyset$ is false, $R$ is not Reflective

### Proof for Symmetricity
For Symmetric condition, 
$$\text{If }(a,b)\in \emptyset, \text{then }(b,a)\in \emptyset$$
Since the hypothesis( "$(a,b)\in \emptyset$" ) can't be true, the statement is true.
Thus, $R$ is Symmetric

### Proof for Transitivity
For Transitive condition,
$$\text{If }(a,b)\in \emptyset \text{ \& }(b,c)\in \emptyset, \text{ then }(a,c)\in \emptyset$$
Since the hypothesis( "$(a,b)\in \emptyset \text{ \& }(b,c)\in \emptyset$" ) can't be true, the entire statement is true.
Thus, $R$ is Transitive

### Proof for Anti-Symmetricity
For Anti-Symmetric condition,
$$\text{If }(a,b)\in R \text{ \& }(b,a)\in R, \text{ then }a=b$$
Since the hypothesis( "$(a,b)\in \emptyset \text{ \& }(a,b)\in \emptyset$" ) can't be true, the entire statement is true.

# Ex) Relation Satisfies All Properties 
For any set of $A$, the relation $R$,
$$R=\{(x,y)\in A\times A \text{ | }x=y\}$$
satisfies all four properties.

## Proof for Reflectivity
Consider $(\alpha, \alpha)$ which $\alpha$ is any element of $A$.
- $\alpha=\alpha$ is always true for any $\alpha$

Thus, $R$ is Reflective

## Proof for Symmetricity
Consider $(\alpha, \beta)$ which $\alpha, \beta \in A$.
- From hypothesis of Symmetricity, $\alpha=\beta$
- Then, since $\alpha=\beta$, $\beta=\alpha$ is also true

Thus, $R$ is Symmetric

## Proof for Transitivity
Consider $\alpha, \beta, \gamma\in A$
- From Hypothesis, $(\alpha,\beta)\in R\text{ \& }(\beta,\gamma)\in R$, thus $\alpha=\beta \text{ \& } \beta=\gamma$
- This leads to $\alpha=\gamma$, thus $(\alpha, \gamma)\in R$

Thus, $R$ is Transitive

## Proof for Anti-Symmetricity
Consider $\alpha, \beta\in A$
- From hepothesis, $(\alpha,\beta)\in R\text{ \& }(\beta,\alpha)\in R$, thus $\alpha=\beta \text{ \& } \beta=\alpha$
- This automatically proves $\alpha=\beta$

Thus, $R$ is Anti-Symmetric

# Ex) Relation Satisfies None of Properties
For set $A=\{a,b,c\}$, relation $R$ on $A$,
$$R=\{(a,a), (a,b), (b,a), (b,c)\}$$

## Proof for Non-Reflectivity
$(b,b), (c,c)\not\in R$
Thus, $R$ is not Reflective

## Proof for Non-Symmetricity
$(b,c)\in R, \text{but }(c,b)\not\in R$

Thus, $R$ is not Symmetric

## Proof for Non-Transitivity
$(a,b)\in R\text{ \& }(b,c)\in R, \text{ but }(a,c)\not\in R$

Thus, $R$ is not Transitive

## Proof for Non Anti-Symmetricity
$(a,b)\in R\text{ \& }(b,a)\in R, \text{ but }a\neq b$

Thus, $R$ is not Anti-Symmetric
\
# Equivalent Relation
A relation on set $A$ that is *Reflective*, *Symmetric*, and *Transitive*
- Regardless of Anti-Symmetric
- If $R$ is an equivalence on a set $A$, write $a$ ~ $b$, if $(a,b)\in R$

**Ex)**
$A=\mathbb{Z} \text{ (integer)}$, $R=\{(a,b)\text{ | } (a,b\text{ are both odd}) \text{ or } (a,b\text{ are both even})\}$

$A=\mathbb{Z} \text{ (integer)}$, $R=\{(a,b)\text{ | } a-b \text{ is divisible by 3}\}$

## Equivalent Class
An equivalent relation on a set $A$ "divides up the set $A$ into different classes"

If $R$ is Equivalence Relation on a set $A$ and $x\in A$, define the equivalence class of $x$, $\bar{x}$, to be 
- $\bar{x}=\{y\in A\text{ | }x$ ~ $y \text{ }(\text{a.k.a }(x,y)\in R)\}\longrightarrow\{\text{Set of all }y\text{ satisfy }x$ ~ $y\}$
- Some equivalent classes are exactly the same

**Ex)**
For Equivalent Relation, $A=\mathbb{Z} \text{ (integer)}$, $R=\{(a,b)\text{ | } a-b \text{ is divisible by 3}\}$

$\dots$
Equivalent class of 1, $\bar{1}=\{\dots-5, -2, 1, 4, 7\dots\}$
Equivalent class of 2, $\bar{2}=\{\dots-4, -1, 2, 5, 8\dots\}$
Equivalent class of 3, $\bar{3}=\{\dots-3, 0, 3, 6, 9\dots\}$
Equivalent class of 4, $\bar{4}=\{\dots-5, -2, 1, 4, 7\dots\}$
$\dots$

Thus, $\bar{1}=\bar{4}$ and so on

## Properties
If $R$ is and Equivalent Relation on a set $A$, then
1. For any $x\in A, x\in \bar{x}$
	- $R$ is reflective, thus for any $x\in A$, $(x,x)\in R$
	  Therefore, $x\in \bar{x}$

2. For any $x,y\in A$, $\bar{x}=\bar{y}\text{ iff }(x,y)\in R$
	- $\bar{x}=\bar{y}\implies(x,y)\in R$
	  From property 1, $x\in \bar{x}$ and $y\in \bar{y}$
	  Since $\bar{x}=\bar{y}$, $y\in \bar{x}$
	  From the definition of Equivalent Class, since $y\in \bar{x}$, $(x,y)\in R$
	
	- $(x,y)\in R\implies\bar{x}=\bar{y}$
	  Let $\alpha$ is any element in $\bar{x}$, $\alpha\in \bar{x}$
	  By the definition of Equivalent Class, $(x,a)\in R$
