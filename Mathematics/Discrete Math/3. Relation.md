Well defined relationship between two sets

**Ex)**
1. $<, >, \leq, \geq\dots$

2. Divisibility( "$|$" )
	- For $a$ and $b$, $a$ is divisible by $b$ ($b|a$) if $\exists \text{ }m\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $b\cdot m=a$

3. Subsets

**4.** Given sets $A$ and $B$, if $\alpha$ is any element of $A$ and $\beta$ is any element of $B$, a relation from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ **is subset of** $A\times B$
	- $R=\{(a,b)\in A\times B\text{ | (relation between }a,b)\}$
	- *Think of things in the subset as things in the relation
	  and things not in the ubset as things not in the relation*

5. Directly Specifying the exact subset is available
	- $A=\{a,b,c\}$, $B=\{x,y,z\}$
	  $R = \{(a,x), (b,x), (a,y), (c,z)\}$ is a valid relation since all ordered pair the in the relation are the element of $A\times B$

6. A relation on $A$ is a relation from $A\times A$

# Properties
## Reflective
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$, $R$ is reflective if 
$$\text{for all } x\in A, (x,x)\in R$$

## Symmetric
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$ and $a,b\in A$, $R$ is symmetric if 
$$\text{Whenever }(a,b)\in R, \text{then }(b,a)\text{ must be in } R$$

## Transitive
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$ and $a,b,c\in A$, $R$ is Transitive if following statement is satisfied:
$$\text{if }(a,b)\in R \text{ \& }(b,c)\in R, \text{ then }(a,c)\in R$$

## Anti-Symmetric
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$ and $a,b\in A$, $R$ is Anti-Symmetric if following statement is satisfied:
$$\text{if }(a,b)$$
