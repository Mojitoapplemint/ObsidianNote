Well defined relationship between two sets

**Ex)**
1. $<, >, \leq, \geq\dots$
2. Divisibility( "$|$" )
	- For $a$ and $b$, $a$ is divisible by $b$ ($b|a$) if $\exists \text{ }m\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $b\cdot m=a$
3. Subsets
4. Given sets $A$ and $B$, if $\alpha$ is any element of $A$ and $\beta$ is any element of $B$, a relation from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ is subset of $A\times B$
	- $R=\{(a,b)\in A\times B\text{ | (relation between }a,b)\}$
	- Think of things in the subset as things in the relation
	  and things not in the ubset as things not in the relation
5. Directly Specifying the exact subset is available
