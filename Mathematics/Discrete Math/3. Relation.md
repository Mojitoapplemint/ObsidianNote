Well defined relationship between two sets

**Ex)**
1. $<, >, \leq, \geq\dots$

2. Divisibility( "$|$" )
	- For $a$ and $b$, $a$ is divisible by $b$ ($b|a$) if $\exists \text{ }m\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $b\cdot m=a$

3. Subsets

**4.** Given sets $A$ and $B$, if $\alpha$ is any element of $A$ and $\beta$ is any element of $B$, a relation from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ **is subset of** $A\times B$
	- $R=\{(a,b)\in A\times B\text{ | (relation between }a,b)\}$
	- *Think of things in the subset as things in the relation
	  and things not in the ubset as things not in the relation*

5. Directly Specifying the exact subset is available
	- $A=\{a,b,c\}$, $B=\{x,y,z\}$
	  $R = \{(a,x), (b,x), (a,y), (c,z)\}$ is a valid relation since all ordered pair the in the relation are the element of $A\times B$

6. A relation on $A$ is a relation from $A\times A$
