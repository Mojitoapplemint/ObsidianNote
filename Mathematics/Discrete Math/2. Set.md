Set is some collection of objects, which don't have any type 
- Objects in one set don't have to be all the same type
- Another set can be an object
- Two sets A and B are equal, written A=B, if every element of A is an element of B, every element of B is an element of A 
	- Order and Repetition doesn’t matter: {1,2} = {1,2,2} = {2,1} 
- Notation: writing object in {}, 
	- Ex) {1,2}, {3, apple, 6.3}, etc. 
- One can also define sets using some pattern
	- Ex) {1,2,3,4…}, {…-2, -1, 0, 1, 2,….} 
- Can also specify a set builder notation 
	- Ex) $\{x|x\in\mathbb{R}, 1<x<10\}$

# Empty Set
Defined to be the unique set with **no element**
- $\emptyset$

$\emptyset\neq\{\emptyset\}$
- LHS: No element
- RHS: 1 element

# Subset
If $A$, $B$ are sets, say $A$ is a subset of $B$, and write $A \subseteq B$, if every element of $A$ is and element of $B$
- Even if $A=B$, $A$ is still a subset of $B$
- If $A$ is subset of $B$, but not equal to $B$, $A\subsetneq B$
- $\emptyset$ is **subset of all sets**

The number of subsets of a set is $2^{\text{Number of element}}$

## Power Set
Power set of $A$, is set of all subset of $A$
- $P(A)$

Ex)
$P(\{a,b,c\})=  \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\},\{a,b\}, \{b,c\}, \{a,c\}, \{a,b,c\}\}$

$P(\emptyset) = \{\emptyset\}$

# Operation with Sets
## Union( $\cup$ )
If $A$ and $B$ are sets, union of $A$ and $B$, written as $A\cup B$, consists of all elements in $A$ **or** $B$

## Intersection( $\cap$ )
If $A$ and $B$ are sets, interesection of $A$ and $B$, written as $A\cap B$, consists of all elements in $A$ **and** $B$

# Set Properties
## Idempotency
- $A\cup A = A\cap A = A$
- $A\cup\emptyset = A$
- $A\cap\emptyset = \emptyset$

## Communitative
- $A\cap B = B\cap A$
- $A\cup B = B\cup A$

## Associativity

## Distributivity
