Set is some collection of objects, which don't have any type 
- Objects in one set don't have to be all the same type
- Another set can be an object
- Two sets A and B are equal, written A=B, if every element of A is an element of B, every element of B is an element of A 
	- Order and Repetition doesn’t matter: {1,2} = {1,2,2} = {2,1} 
- Notation: writing object in {}, Ex) {1,2}, {3, apple, 6.3}, etc. One can also define sets using some pattern ◼ Ex) {1,2,3,4…}, {…-2, -1, 0, 1, 2,….} Can also specify a set builder notation ◼ Ex) {Real number x | 1
