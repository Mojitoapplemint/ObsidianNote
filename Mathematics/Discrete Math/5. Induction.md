# Induction
1. Prove the **Base Case**: Prove the statement at the lowest $n$
2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that the statement is true for $n=k$ 
3. **Inductive Step**: Then, using this hypothesis, we need to prove that the statement is true for $n=k+1$
	- If the statement is true for $n=k$, then it is true for $n=k+1$

## Ex) Prove $3^{n}<n!$ for all integers $n>6$
let $P(n)$ be $3^{n}<n!$

Since $n\geq 7$, the base case is $P(7)$

Base Case
- $3^{7}=2187$ and $7!= 5040$.
- Thus, $P(7)$ is true

Inductive Hypothesis
- Suppose $P(k)$ is true for arbitrary integer $k\geq 7$
- $3^{k}<k!$

Inductive Step
- We will prove $3^{k+1}<(k+1)!$
- From $3^{k}<k!$
  $3\cdot{3}^{k}<3\cdot k!$  (multiplying both sides by 3)
- Since $k\geq 7$, $3<k+1$
- Thus, $3\cdot k! < (k+1)\cdot k! =(k+1)!$
- Therefore, $3\cdot 3^{k}=3^{k+1}<(k+1)!$
	- $P(k+1)$ is true
