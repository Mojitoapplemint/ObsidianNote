# Induction
1. Prove the **Base Case**: Prove the statement at the lowest $n$
2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that the statement is true for $n=k$ 
3. **Inductive Step**: Then, using this hypothesis, we need to prove that the statement is true for $n=k+1$
	- If the statement is true for $n=k$, then it is true for $n=k+1$

## Ex) Prove $3^{n}<n!$ for all integers $n>6$
let $P(n)$ be $3^{n}<n!$

Since $n\geq 7$, the base case is $P(7)$

Base Case
- $3^{7}=2187$ and $7!= 5040$.
- Thus, $P(7)$ is true

Inductive Hypothesis
- Suppose $P(k)$ is true for arbitrary integer $k\geq 7$
- $3^{k}<k!$

Inductive Step
- We will prove $3^{k+1}<(k+1)!$
- Fro
- m $3^{k}<k!$, we can drive $3\cdot{3}^{k}=3^{k+1}<3\cdot(k+1)!$ by multiplying both sides by3
