# Mathematical Statement
A statement is something which can be **assigned a truth value**
- Somethings is either true or false (or we don’t know) 

**Ex)**
- There are an infinite of prime number (O) 
- “Let x be a real number,” “What is a number?”(X)

## Different Type of Statement
Conjecture
- A statement which we believe to be true, but cannot yet prove 

Lemma -> Proposition -> Theorem
- All types of statements which *have been proven*
- Roughly in increasing order of difficulty and/or important 

Axiom
- A statement that is *assumed to be true*

# Logical Operation
## And( $\wedge$ )
True if both p and q are true, unless it’s false or unknown (True & Unknown) 

## Or( $\lor$ )
True at least one of them are true.

“$p\text{ XOR } q$ / $p\oplus q$"
- Only true if one of them is true, not both

## Implication( $p\longrightarrow q$  / $p\implies q$)
“$\text{if }p\text{, then }q$" : ( $p\longrightarrow q$ )
“$p\text{ implies }q$” : ( $p\implies q$ )
- **True if whenever p is true, q is also true **
- To show an implication is false, find counter example(p is true, but q is false)
- *The only case it’s false if p is true, but q is false *

**Note)**
If $p$ is always false, then we take "$p\longrightarrow q$" to *be true*, regardless $q$ is true or false 
- If 0=1, then 1+1=5 : is considered as true 

## If and only if ( $p\longleftrightarrow q$ / $p\iff q$ / $p\text{ iff }q$)
- True if whenever p is true, q is true, and whenever q is true, then p is true 
- Original statement and its converse are both true 

## Not P ( $\lnot p$ )
true if p is false, and false if p is true 

## Converse
For original statement $p\longrightarrow q$ , its converse statement is $q \longrightarrow p$ 
- Even if the original statement is true, converse can be false or true 

## Contrapositive
Converse + Not
- $p\longrightarrow q\text{ }\implies \text{ }\lnot q\longrightarrow\lnot p$
- *The boolean value of contrapositive is equal to its original statement*
- The contrapositive of “Not statement” is the converse of its original statement

# Prove Methods
## Proof by Cases
- Do different proofs depending different cases

## Proof by contrapositive
Since contrapositive has same true/false value with the original statement, **prove contrapositive to prove the original **

## Proof by contradiction
*Assume what you want to prove is false*, then do some calculations and/or other reasoning to **find something impossible as a result**

# Truth Table
Two statements are logically equivalent if their truth or falsity is exactly same in all cases
- Can do this with Truth Table: Listing all possible values of $p$, $q$ and what the truth value of the compound statements are

| p   | q   | $\lnot q$ | $p\wedge\lnot q$ |
| --- | --- | --------- | ---------------- |
| T   | T   | F         | F                |
| T   | F   | T         | T                |
| F   | T   | F         | F                |
| F   | F   | T         | F                |

# Logical Operation Properties
## deMorgan’s law
$$\lnot(p\wedge q) = \lnot p \lor \lnot q$$
$$\lnot(p\lor q) = \lnot p \wedge \lnot q$$

## Implication Equivalent
$$p\longrightarrow q \iff \lnot p \lor q$$

## Associativity
$$p\lor(q\lor r)\iff (p\lor q)\lor r$$
$$p\wedge(q\wedge r)\iff (p\wedge q)\wedge r$$
## Distributivity
$$p\wedge(q\lor r)\iff (p\wedge q)\lor (p\wedge r)$$
$$p\lor(q\wedge r)\iff (p\lor q)\wedge (p\lor r)$$

## Idempotency
$$p\wedge p \iff p\lor p \iff p$$

## Commutativity
$$p\wedge q = q\wedge p$$
$$p\lor q = q\lor p$$

## Double Inference Rule
$$p\longleftrightarrow q \iff(p \longrightarrow q)\wedge(q \longrightarrow p)$$

## Double Negation
$$\lnot(\lnot p)\iff p$$

## Operation with True and False
Let $T$ be truth statement and $F$ be false statement
- $p\wedge T\iff p$
- $p\wedge F\iff F$
- $p\lor T\iff T$
- $p\lor F\iff p$
- $p\lor\lnot p \iff T$
- $p\wedge\lnot p \iff F$

# Arguments
A series of statements, called the premises followed by another statement called the conclusion 
- Valid *if wherever all the premises are true, so is the conclusion* 

Notation: Premises each in a line, above the conclusion

	$P_{1}$
	$P_{2}$
	$P_{3}$
	$\color{white} \rule{3cm}{1pt}$
	$\text{Thus, }Q$

Constructing a truth table for the statement involved, and check that whenever the conclusion is always true if premises are all true

## Example
Show validity of following argument

	$p\longrightarrow q$
	$\lnot p$
	$\color{white} \rule{3cm}{1.5pt}$
	$\lnot q$

| $p$ | $q$ | $p\longrightarrow q$ | $\lnot p$ | $\lnot q$ |
| --- | --- | -------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| T   | T   | T                    | F         | F         |
| T   | F   | F                    | F         | T         |
| F   | T   | **T**                | **T**     | **F**     |
| F   | F   | **T**                | **T**     | **T**     |
Since the conlcusion is not always true when all premises are true, this argument is not valid

## Standard Argument
$$
\small
\begin{array} \\
\text{1. Modus Ponens} & \text{2. Modus Tollens} & \text{3. Disjuctive Syllogism} & \text{4. Chain Rule} & \text{5. Resolution}  \\
p\longrightarrow q & p\longrightarrow q & p\lor q & p\longrightarrow q & p \lor r \\
p & \lnot q & \lnot p & q\longrightarrow r & q \lor \lnot r  \\
 \\
\hline
q & \lnot p & q & p \longrightarrow r & p \lor q
\end{array}
$$

- For Chain Rule, it doesn't means that combining premises are not equivalent to the conclusion
