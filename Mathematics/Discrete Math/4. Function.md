Function from set $A$ to set $B$ is defined to be relation from $A$ to $B$ so that for any $x$ in $A$, there is **exactly one** $y$ in $B$ that $(x,y)\in f$
- $A$ is called *domain*
- $B$ is called *codomain*\

Notation)
$f:A\to B$

$f:A\to B$
   $\text{(input 1)}\longmapsto \text{output 1}$
   $\text{(input 2)}\longmapsto \text{output 2}$
   $\dots$

# Properties
**1-1(One to one)**: Every single input leads to different output
- If input is different, then output is different
- If $f(m_{1})=f(m_{2})$, then $m_{1}=m_{2}$

**Onto**: Every single elements in codomain, there is at least one input that corresponds to it
- For all $b\in B$, $\exists \text{ }a\in A$ such that $f(a)=b$
- *Codomain is equivalent to range*

# Composite
For function $f$ and $g$, if $f: A\to B$ and $g:B\to C$, then
$$g(f(x)): A\to C$$
is a composite of $f$ and $g$
- Also written as $g*f(x) \text{ or } (g*f)(x)$
- If both $f$ and $g$ are 1-1 or onto, then composite is also 1-1 or onto

## Proof for 1-1
Let $f$ and $g$ are 1-1. We need to prove for any $a_{1}, a_{2}\in A$,
$$\text{If }g(f(a_{1}))=g(f(a_{2}))\text{ , then } a_{1}=a_{2}$$

If $g(f(a_{1}))=g(f(a_{2}))$, then $f(a_{1})=f(a_{2})$ since $g$ is 1-1

If $f(a_{1})=f(a_{2})$, then $a_{1}=a_{2}$ since $f$is 1-1

Thus, $g(f(x))$ is 1-1

## Proof for Onto
Let $f$ and $g$ are Onto. We need to prove for all $c\in C$, 
$$\text{There is some } a\in A \text{ so that } g(f(a))=c$$

Since $g$ is onto, there is some $b\in B$ so that $g(b)=c$ 

Then, since $f$ is also onto, there is some $a \in A$ that $f(a) = b$ 

Thus, for $c\in C$, there is some $a\in A$ that $g(f(a)) = g(b) = c$


# Inverse Function
If $f:A\to B$ is a function, an inverse for $f$ is a function $g:B\to A$ for so that all $a\in A$,
$$g(f(a))=a\text{ \& }f(g(b))=b$$
