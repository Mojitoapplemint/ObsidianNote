Function from set $A$ to set $B$ is defined to be relation from $A$ to $B$ so that for any $x$ in $A$, there is **exactly one** $y$ in $B$ that $(x,y)\in f$
- $A$ is called *domain*
- $B$ is called *codomain*\

Notation)
$f:A\to B$

$f:A\to B$
   $\text{(input 1)}\longmapsto \text{output 1}$
   $\text{(input 2)}\longmapsto \text{output 2}$
   $\dots$

# Properties
## 1-1(One to one)
Every single input leads to different output
- If input is different, then output is different
- If $f(m_{1})=f(m_{2})$, then $m_{1}=m_{2}$

## Onto
Every single elements in codomain, there is at least one input that corresponds to it
- For all $b\in B$, $\exists \text{ }a\in A$ such that $f(a)=b$
- *Codomain is equivalent to range*

# When are the functions equal?
1. Their Domain and Codomain are equal
2. And their values are equal on all inputs

# Composite
For function $f$ and $g$, if $f: A\to B$ and $g:B\to C$, then
$$g(f(x)): A\to C$$
is a composite of $f$ and $g$
- Also written as $g*f(x) \text{ or } (g*f)(x)$
- If both $f$ and $g$ are 1-1 or onto, then composite is also 1-1 or onto

## Proof for 1-1
Let $f$ and $g$ are 1-1. We need to prove for any $a_{1}, a_{2}\in A$,
$$\text{If }g(f(a_{1}))=g(f(a_{2}))\text{ , then } a_{1}=a_{2}$$

If $g(f(a_{1}))=g(f(a_{2}))$, then $f(a_{1})=f(a_{2})$ since $g$ is 1-1

If $f(a_{1})=f(a_{2})$, then $a_{1}=a_{2}$ since $f$is 1-1

Thus, $g(f(x))$ is 1-1

## Proof for Onto
Let $f$ and $g$ are Onto. We need to prove for all $c\in C$, 
$$\text{There is some } a\in A \text{ so that } g(f(a))=c$$

Since $g$ is onto, there is some $b\in B$ so that $g(b)=c$ 

Then, since $f$ is also onto, there is some $a \in A$ that $f(a) = b$ 

Thus, for $c\in C$, there is some $a\in A$ that $g(f(a)) = g(b) = c$


# Inverse Function
If $f:A\to B$ is a function, an inverse for $f$ is a function $g:B\to A$ for so that all $a\in A$,
$$g(f(a))=a\text{ \& }f(g(b))=b$$
- We need to prove **both directions** of $g(f(a))=a\text{ \& }f(g(b))=b$
- If inverse exist, then **it is unique**

## The function satisfy both 1-1 and onto if and only if it has in inverse function
### Direction 1: If $f$ has an inverse function, then $f$ is 1-1 and onto

**For 1-1**, suppose that we have $a_{1}, a_{2}\in A$ so that $f(a_{1})=f(a_{2})$
- We need to prove $a_{1}=a_{2}$

Since $g$ is also a function, $g(f(a_{1}))=g(f(a_{2}))$

Then, since $g$ is an inverse function of $f$, $g(f(a_{1}))=a_{1}$ and $g(f(a_{2}))=a_{2}$
- Thus $a_{1}=a_{2}$

**For onto**, we need to show that for any $b\in B$, there is some $a\in A$ so that $f(a)=b$

Since $g$ is an inverse function, we can define it as $g(b)=a$
- This is valid since $g:B\to A$

Then, $f(a)=f(g(b))=b$

Thus, we found an $a\in A$ so that $f(a)=b$, so $f$ is onto

### Direction 2: If $f$ is 1-1 and onto, then $f$ has an inverse function $g:B\to A$
Since $f$ is onto, for any $b\in B$, there is at least one $a\in A$ so that $f(a)=b$

Why can't there be more than one such $a$? Because $f$ is 1-1, *there can be only one* $a$

So we can define $g(b)$ to be unique element of $a\in A$ so that $g(b)=a$

Therefore, for any $a\in A$, $g(f(a))=a$by how $g$ is defined, and for any $b\in B$, $f(g(b))=f(a)=b$

## Bijection
Function that is 1-1 and onto
- Inverse function of a bijection is also a bijection
- If we have a bijection, $f:A\to b$, we can think of this as a way of uniquely matching each element of $A$ to each element of $B$
	- If there is a bijection $f:A\to B$, then we say that **they have the same cardinality**

# Cardinality
## Cardinality for [[2. Set#Finite Set|Finite Sets]]
If $A$ and $B$ each have a **finite number** of elements, then *they have the same Cardinality iff they have the same number of elements*
### Proof 1 )
Suppose $A=\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots a_{n}\}$ and $B:\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \dots b_{n}\}$ have the $n$ elements.

Then define function
$f:A\to B$
   $a_{1}\longmapsto b_{1}$
   $a_{2}\longmapsto b_{2}$
   $\dots$
   $a_{n}\longmapsto b_{n}$

Then, $f$ is bijection, $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality

### Proof 2 )
[[1. Basic Logic Fundamentals#Proof by contrapositive|Prove by contrapositive]]: If $A$ and $B$ have a different number of elements, then $A$ and $B$ can't have the same cardinality

Suppose $A=\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots a_{m}\}$ and $B:\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \dots b_{n}\}$
- If $m>n$, then there is no function $f:A\to B$ that is 1-1
- If $m<n$, then there is no function $f:A\to B$ that is onto
Since either case can't have bijection, $A$ and $B$ can't have the same cardinality

## Cardinality for [[2. Set#Infite Set|Infinite Sets]]
Having the same cardinality is [[3. Relation#Equivalent Relation|Equivalence Relation]]
### Reflexive
For any set A, we need to show that $A$ has the same cardinality with A, meaning that we have to find a bijection $f:A\to A$ 
	- Define 
	 $f:A\to A$
		$a\longmapsto a$
	 This is clearly 1-1 and onto, thus it is bijection, they have the same cardinality 

### Symmetric
If $A$ has the same cardinality as $B$, have bijection $f:A\to B$, we need $B$ to have same cardinality as $A$, i.e need a bijection $g:B\to A$
	- Since $f$ is bijection, it will have an inverse, $g$, and we stated that inverse to a bijection is also bijection. Thus $g$ is bijection, they have the same cardinality 

### Transitive
Suppose $A$ has same cardinality as $B$, and $B$ the same as $C$, i.e there are bijection $f_{1}=A\to B$ and $f_{2}=B\to C$ we have to show the existence of bijection $A\to C$ 
	- Compose of $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$, is also 1-1 and onto, $A$ and $C$ have the same cardinality

**Ex)**
- $A=\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3\dots\}$ and $B=\{2,4,6\dots\}$, do they have the same cardinality?
Define 
$f:A\to B$
   $x\longmapsto 2x$
- Then this function is 1-1 and onto, thus bijection. They have the same cardinality

- $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{+}$ have the same cardinality
- $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ have the same cardinality
