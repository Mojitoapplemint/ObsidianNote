# Vector-Valued Function
Functions $f:\mathbb{R}^{m}\to\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (typically with $m,n\geq2$) that are not necessaily linear transformation
- Takes vector and return vector

# Paths
Let's start with the $m=1$

Let $I\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be an interval. Then a path is a continuous function $\vec{f}:I\to\mathbb{R}^{n}$
- Continous means that let $\vec{f}(t)=(f_{1}(t), f_{2}(t)\dots f_{n}(t))$, then each $f_{i}:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous
