# Lemma 3.1: Every integer greater than 1 has a prime diviser
For proof by contradiction, suppose *there is positive integer greater than 1 that has no prime divisers*
- Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that has no prime divisers

If $n$ is prime, we have a contradiction that it has $n$ itself as prime diviser

Otherwise, $n$ is composite 
- $\exists \text{ }a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $1<a, b<n$ and $ab=n$
- Since $n$ is the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that has no prime diviser and $a<n$, $a$ must have prime diviser. Let it $x$
- BY theorem 1.8, since $x$ divides $a$ and $a$ divides $n$, we can get $x$ can divide $n$
- Again there is contradiction that $n$ has prime diviser $x$

Therefore, every integer greater than 1 has a prime diviser by proof by contradiction

# Theorem 3.1: There are infinitely many primes
For proof by contradiction, suppose there is finite amount, $n$ prime numbers
- $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, \dots p_{n}$ are all the primes

Let $A=p_{1}\cdot p_{2}\cdot\dots p_{n}+1$
by Lemma 3.1, $A$ has a prime diviser, $p_{k},$
