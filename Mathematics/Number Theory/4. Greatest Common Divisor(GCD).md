The GCD of two integers $a,b$ (which are not both zero) is the largest integer that divides both $a$ and $b$
- Notation: $gcd(a,b)$
- $gcd(a,0)=a$ when $a$ is positive integer
- Define $gcd(0,0)=0$
	- Since any number can divides 0, $gcd(0,0)$ can be infinitely large
- Always non-negative

# Relatively Prime
The non-zero integers $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime if $gcd(a,b)=1$

# Theorem 3.7: Let $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{Z}$, then $gcd(a,b)=gcd(a+cb, b)$

# Bezout's Theorem
Let $a,b,\in\mathbb{Z}$. Then there exists $m,n$ such tht $gcd(a,b)=ma+nb$
- If $a,b$ are both integers then a linear combination of $a$ and $b$ is a sum of the form $ma+nb$ where $m,n\in\mathbb{Z}$

# Theorem 3.8: Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ are not both zero. Then $gcd(a,b)$is the least positive integer that is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$
This exists since if $a\neq 0$, either
- $1\cdot a+0\cdot b=a$ when$a>0$
- $-1\cdot a+0\cdot b=-a$ when$a<0$

Let $d$ be the least positive integer that is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$
- $d\geq 1$

Then $d=ma+nb$ for some integers $m,n$

$\to$ show $d$ is a common divisor of $a,b$
$\to$ Show it's greatest

By the Division Algorithm, $a=dq+r$ for some unique $q,r\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $0\leq r<d$
- Wants to show that $r=0$
	$r=a-dq=a-(ma+nb)q$ 
	$=a(1-mq)+b(-nq)$
	Since $1-mq$ and $-nq$ are integer, $r$ is a linear combination of $a,b$ and $0\leq r<d$ 
	
	Since $d$ is sma



# Theorem 3.6: Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}: a,b \neq 0$ with $gcd(a,b)=d$, then $gcd\left( \frac{a}{d},\frac{b}{d} \right)=1$
Proof by Contradiction. Assume $gcd\left( \frac{a}{d},\frac{b}{d} \right)\neq 1$ 
- GCD is always non-negative. Since $a,b\neq 0$, GCD must be $\ge {1}$. Therefore, if $gcd\left( \frac{a}{d},\frac{b}{d} \right)\neq 1$, then $gcd\left( \frac{a}{d},\frac{b}{d} \right)>1$
- Let $gcd\left( \frac{a}{d},\frac{b}{d} \right)=x, x>1$

Then $\frac{a}{d}=xh$ and $\frac{b}{d}=xk$ where $h,k\in\mathbb{Z}$
 $\implies a=xdh$ and $b=xdk$

$xd$ became a common factor between $a,b$

Consider $x>1$.
- Since $d\geq 1$, $xd>d$
- This contrasts that there is common factor that is greater than GCD

Therefore, $gcd\left( \frac{a}{d},\frac{b}{d} \right)=1$
