The GCD of two integers $a,b$ (which are not both zero) is the largest integer that divides both $a$ and $b$
- Notation: $gcd(a,b)$
- $gcd(a,0)=a$ when $a$ is positive integer
- Define $gcd(0,0)=0$
	- Since any number can divides 0, $gcd(0,0)$ can be infinitely large

# Relatively Prime
The non-zero integers $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime if $gcd(a,b)=1$

# Theorem 3.7: Let $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{Z}$, then $gcd(a,b)=gcd(a+cb, b)$

# Bezout's Theorem
Let $a,b,c,\in\mathbb{Z}$. Then there exists $m,n$ such tht $gcd(a,b)=ma+nb$
- If $a,b$ are both integers then a linear combination of $a$ and $b$ is a sum of the form $ma+nb$ where $m,n\in\mathbb{Z}$

# Theorem 3.8: Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ are not both zero. Then $gcd(a,b)$is the least positive integer that is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$
