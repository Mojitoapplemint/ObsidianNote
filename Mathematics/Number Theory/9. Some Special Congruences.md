# Proposition
If $ab\equiv x\text{ (mod }m)$ and $cd\equiv y\text{ (mod }m)$, then $abcd\equiv xy\text{ (mod }m)$

# Wilson's Theorem
If $p$ is prime, then $(p-1)!\equiv -1\text{ (mod }p)$

**Proof)**
Suppose $p$ is prime

i) If $p=2$, then $(p-1)\neq 1\equiv -1 \text{ (mod }2)$

ii) When $p>2$ ($p$ is odd)
Consider $a\in\{1,2,3\dots p-1\}$. Since $p$ is prime, $gcd(a,p)=1$

$\therefore$ a has inverse $\bar{a}$ modulo $p$

[[7. Conguents#Theorem 4.12|Theorem 4.12]]  told us $a^{2}\equiv 1 \text{ (mod }p)$ iff $a\equiv 1$ or $a\equiv -1 \text{ (mod }p)$
- So, the only integer in $\{1,2,\dots p-1\}$ that one their own inverses are 1 and $p-1$
- Thus, let's consier $\{2,3\dots p-1\}$

We group $2,3,\dots p-2$ into $\frac{p-3}{2}$ pairs that are congruent to $1\text{ (mod }p)$

**Claim)** No two integers in my list have the same inverse mod $p$

Proof by contradiction: Suppose $ax\equiv 1\text{ (mod }p)$ and $(a+j)x\equiv 1$
