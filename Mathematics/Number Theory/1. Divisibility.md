Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $a\neq 0$. Then $a\text{ | }b$ iff $ax=b$ for some $x\in\mathbb{Z}$
- We read $a\text{ | }b$ as "$a$ divides $b$"

# Theorem 1.8: If $a,b,c\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $a\text{ | }b$ and $b\text{ | }c$, then $a\text{ | }c$
From hypothesis, $ax=b, by=c$ for some $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$
- Then, $axy=c$

Since $xy\in\mathbb{Z}$, we got $a\text{ | }c$

# Division Algorithm
Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $b\neq 0$. Then there exists unique $q,r\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $0\leq r<|b|$ such that $a=bq+r$

## Proof
If $a=0$, then $q=0$ and $r=0$ gives a solution
- Thus, it is suffices to consider either $a>0$ and $a<0$

### $q,r$ necessarily exist
Let $S=\{a-bk : k\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ and let $T\subseteq S$ be the set of all nonnegative integers in $S$

#### First, $T$ is **nonempty**
Since $T=\{a-bk: a-bk\geq 0, k\in\mathbb{Z}\}$, we choose an integer $k=-b$.
- Then $a-bk=a+b^{2}$ which is positive since $a>0$ abd $b^{2}\geq 0$
- Since it is positive integer, therefore be in set $T$
- There is at least one element in $T$, thus nonempty

#### Well-Ordering Principle
i.e. $T$ has a **least element**
- Since $T$ consists of non-negative integer, non-empty set $T$ will have a smallest integer

Well-Ordering Principle
- Every non-empty set of positive integers has a least element

#### Continue
Let $r$ be the least element in $T$. Then $a-bq=r$ for some $q\in\mathbb{Z}$
- We want to show that $0\leq r<b$

Since $T$ is set of non-negative integers, $r\geq 0$

Prove $r<b$ by contradiction: Suppose $r\geq b$
- $r=a-bq\geq b\implies a\geq b+bq=b(1+q)\implies a-b(1+q)\geq 0$
- Let $r'=a-b(1+q)\geq 0$, then $r'<r$

Since $q+1\in\mathbb{Z}$ , $r'\in T$. But this contradicts the fact that $r$ is the least nonnegative integer in $T$
- Therefore, $r<b$

As a result, there exists $q,r\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $0\leq r<|b|$ such that $a=bq$
- Not necessaily unique

### $q,r$ are unique
Suppose $a=bq_{1}+r_{1}$ and $a=bq_{2}+r_{2}$ where $0\leq r_{1},r_{2}<b$
- Then $0=b(q_{1}-q_{2})+(r_{1}-r_{2})\implies r_{1}-r_{2}=b(q_{2}-q_{1})$

Since $0\leq r_{1},r_{2}<b$, $-b< r_{1}-r_{2}<b$
 $\implies -b<b(q_{2}-q_{1})<b$

As $b\neq 0$, we can divide $b$ to all sides $\implies -1<q_{2}-q_{1}<1$
 - Since $q_{2}-q_{1}$ is an integer, we know $q_{2}-q_{1}=0$

Therefore, $q_{1}=q_{2}$ and $r_{1}=r_{2}$
