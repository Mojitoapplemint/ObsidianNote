Consider 
$$6x+15y=83$$
Do integers $x,y$ exist to satisfy the equation?

# Definition
The equation
$$ax+by=c$$
where $a,b,c\in\mathbb{Z}$ is called a **Linear Diophantine Equation**
- $gcd(a,b)\text{ | }c$ must be true

# Theorem 3.23
Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $d=gcd(a,b)$. Consider $ax+by=c$
- If $d \text{ }|\not\text{ } c$, then equation has no integral solution
- If $d\text{ | }c$, then the equation has infinitely many solution
