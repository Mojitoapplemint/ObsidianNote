The GCD of two integers $a,b$ (which are not both zero) is the largest integer that divides both $a$ and $b$
- Notation: $gcd(a,b)$
- $gcd(a,0)=a$ when $a$ is positive integer
- Define $gcd(0,0)=0$
	- Since any number can divides 0, $gcd(0,0)$ can be infinitely large

# Relatively Prime
The non-zero integers $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime if $gcd(a,b)=1$
