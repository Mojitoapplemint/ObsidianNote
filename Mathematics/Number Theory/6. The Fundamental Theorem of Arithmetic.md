# Lemma 3.4
Let $a,b,c\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ such that $gcd(a,b)=1$ and $a|(bc)$. Then $a|c$

# Lemma 3.5 (Prime Divisibility)
Suppose $p$ divides $q_{1}q_{2}\dots q_{t}$ while $p$ is prime $q_{i}'s$ are positive integers. There $\exists \text{ }$ integer $i\in [t]$ such that $p|q_{i}$
- $[t] = \{1,2,\dots t\}$ 

Since $p|q_{1}q_{2}\dots q_{t}$
- Then, either $p|q_{1}$ or $p|q_{2}q_{3}\dots q_{t}$
- If $p|q_{1}$, then we are done

For $p|q_{2}q_{3}\dots q_{t}$,
- Either $p|q_{2}$ or $p|q_{3}q_{4}\dots q_{t}$
- If $p|q_{2}$, then we are done

$\vdots$

Even if it goes till the end, there must be at least one $q$ that can be divisible by $p$

# Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Every positive integer greater than 1 can be written as uniquely as a product of primes

Let $n$ be a positive integer >1

For a contradiction, suppose $n$ cannot be written as a product of primes
- Let $m$ be the smallest positive integer $>1$ that can't be written as a product of primes. Since set of $n$ is Well-Ordering Principle, there is the smallest 

 $\implies$ If $m$ is prime, we're done
 $\implies$ Otherwise, $m$ is composite, let $m=ab$

Since $m$ is the smallest number that can't be written as product of prime and $a,b<m$, $a,b$ must be able to be written as products of primes
- Then $m$ also can be written as a product of primes
- Thus, it contradicts the initial assumption

$\therefore$ $m$ can be written as product of prime (Not sure about uniqueness yet)

**Uniqueness)**
Suppose $n$ has 2 primes factorizations
$n=p_{1}p_{2}\dots p_{s}$
$n=q_{1}q_{2}\dots q_{t}$

both $p_{i}'s, q_{i}'s$ are primes

Since $p_{1}|n$, so $p_{1}|q_{1}q_{2}\dots q_{t}$

By Lemma 3.5, $p_{1}|q_{i}$ for some $i\in[t]$

WLOG, suppose $p_{1}|q_{1}$
- Since both of them are prime, $p_{1}=q_{1}$

So now, 
$p_{2}p_{3}\dots p_{s}=q_{2}q_{3} \dots q_{t}$

Repeat the same process
- $p_{2}=q_{2}$

Repeat this process, then we will eventually ended up to $p_{1}=q_{1}$, $p_{2}=q_{2}$, till the end
- Thus, it is unique
