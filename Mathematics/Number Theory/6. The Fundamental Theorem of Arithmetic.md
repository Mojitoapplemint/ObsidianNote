# Lemma 3.4
Let $a,b,c\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ such that $gcd(a,b)=1$ and $a|(bc)$. Then $a|c$

# Lemma 3.5 (Prime Divisibility)
Suppose $p$ divides $q_{1}q_{2}\dots q_{t}$ while $p$ is prime $q_{i}'s$ are positive integers. There $\exists \text{ }$ integer $i\in [t]$ such that $p|q_{i}$
- $[t] = \{1,2,\dots t\}$ 

Since $p|q_{1}q_{2}\dots q_{t}$
- Then, either $p|q_{1}$ or $p|q_{2}q_{3}\dots q_{t}$
- If $p|q_{1}$, then we are done

For $p|q_{2}q_{3}\dots q_{t}$,
- Either $p|q_{2}$ or $p|q_{3}q_{4}\dots q_{t}$
- If $p|q_{2}$, then we are done

$\vdots$

Even if it goes till the end, there must be at least one $q$ that can be divisible by $p$


# Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Every positive integer greater than 1 can be written as uniquely as a product of primes

Let $n$ be a positive integer >1

For a contradiction, suppose $n$ cannot
