Suppose we wich to know if there is some power (depending on $m$) such that $a^{?}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }m)$

Impossible if $a$ and $m$ are not relatively prime
- If $a^{k}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }m)$
	 $my=a^{k}-1$
	 $a^{k}-my=1$
	 $a(a^{k-1})+m(-y)=1$
	 $\therefore gcd(a,m)=1$

Consider a set $A=\{a\text{ | } 1\leq a\leq m \text{ \& }gcd(a,m)=1\}$
- $\phi(m)$

# Euler Phi Function $\phi(m)$
Let $m\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Then Euler Phi Function $\phi(m)$ is defined to be the number of positive integers not exceeding $m$ that are relatively prime to $m$

Ex)
If $m$ is prime, then $\phi(m)=m-1$

Ex)
Suppose we want a power of 7 that is congruent to 1 modulo 10
- $7^{k}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$

Consider $\phi(10)=4 \implies \{1,3,7,9\}$

Multiply each number by 7 $\implies \{7,21,49,63\}$

By taking mod 10 $\implies\{7,1,9,3\}$
- We got the same set again
- Looks like Fermat's Little Theorem

Then, 
$$(7\cdot(1))(7\cdot(3))(7\cdot(7))(7\cdot(9))\equiv 1\cdot 3\cdot 7 \cdot 9\text{ (mod }10)$$
$$7^{4}(1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7) \equiv 1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7\text{ (mod }10)$$
$$7^{4}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$$
It seems liek $7^{\phi(10)}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$

# Theorem 6.14: Euler's Theorem
If $m\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ and $a$ is an integer such that $gcd(a,m)=1$, then
$$a^{\phi(m)}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }m)$$

**Note)**
Since Euler's Theorem consider numbers that are relatively prime with $m$, we can't use complete system of residue, like we did to prove Fermat's Little Theorem. Instead, let's define another system

## Reduced Residue System Modulo $m$
Integers such that each element of the set if relatively prime to $m$ and no two distinct elements in the set are congruent modulo $m$
- Simply is a set of $\phi(m)$
- Start from Complete Residue System and remove element that is not relatively prime with $m$

Ex) 
Consider 6
- Complete Residue System mod 6 : $\{0,1,2,3,4, 5\}$
- Reduced Residue System mod 6 : $\{1,5\}$

## Proof)
Let $r_{1}, r_{2}\dots r_{\phi(m)}$ be reduced residue system mod $m$ were $r_{i}$ is the least positive residue mod $m$

Let $a$ be an integer such that $gcd(a,m)=1$
- Then, let's show $ar_{1}, ar_{2}, \dots ar_{\phi(m)}$ is a reduced residue system mod $m$

First $gcd(a,m)=1$ by assertion, and $gcd(r_{i}, m)=1$
- Then $gcd(ar_{i}, m)=1$

Suppose $ar_{i}\equiv ar_{j}\text{ (mod }m)$ for some $i\neq j$ and $1\leq i,j\leq\phi(m)$
- So, $m|a(r_{i}-r_{j})$

Since $gcd(a,m)=1$ this means $m|(r_{i}-r_{j})$
- Thus, $r_{i}\equiv r_{j}\text{ (mod }m)$
- But this is a contradiction since $r_{1}, r_{2}\dots r_{\phi(m)}$ is a reduced residue system mod $m$, thus $r_{i}\not\equiv r_{j}\text{ (mod }m)$ where $i\neq j$

So, $ar_{1}, ar_{2}\dots ar_{\phi(m)}$ is a reduced residue system mod $m$

So the least positive integers (mod $m$) of $ar_{1}, ar_{2}, \dots ar_{\phi(m)}$ are $r_{1}, r_{2}\dots r_{\phi(m)}$
- Not necessarily in the same order

Therefore, 
$$(ar_{1})(ar_{2})\dots(ar_{\phi(m)})\equiv r_{1}\cdot r_{2}\dots r_{\phi(m)}\text{ (mod }m)$$
$$a^{\phi(m)}\cdot r_{1}\cdot r_{2}\dots r_{\phi(m)}\equiv r_{1}\cdot r_{2}\dots r_{\phi(m)}\text{ (mod }m)$$
We can cancel $r_{i}$'s since each is relativelt prime to $m$,
$$\therefore  a^{\phi(m)}\equiv 1 \text{ (mod }m)$$
## Example)
Find the least non negative residue of $2^{121}$ mod $9$

So, $a=2$ and $m=9$, then $gcd(a,m)=1$

Then by Euler's Theorem, $2^{\phi(9)}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }9)$

Consider $\phi(9) \to\{1,2,4,5,7,8\}$
- $\phi(9)=6$

Since $121 = 20\cdot{6}+1$, 
- $2^{121} = (2^{6})^{20}\cdot 2\equiv 2\text{ (mod }9)$

## Example 2)
Find least positive residue $x\text{ (mod }10)$ of $3x\equiv 7\text{ (mod }10)$

Let $m=10$ and $a=3$.

Since $gcd(3,10)=1$, then by Euler's Theorem, 
$$3^{\phi(10)}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$$
$\phi(10)=4$ $(\{1,3,7,9\})$
- Thus, $3^{4}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$

This tells use that $3$ and $3^{3}$ are inverses mod $10$
- And $3^{2}$ is its own inverse

Multiply $3^{3}$ to both sides to the equation above
$3^{3}\cdot 3x\equiv 3^{3}\cdot7\text{ (mod }10)$
$3^{4}x\equiv x\equiv 3^{3}\cdot 7=27\cdot7\equiv9 \text{ (mod }m)$

# Chapter 7: Euler-Phi Function
How can we find $\phi(m)$?

If $m$ is prime, then $\phi(m)=m-1$
- How about its converse?

Suppose $m$ is an positive integer with $\phi(m)=m-1$

i) If $m$ is prime

ii) If $m=1$
- $\phi(1)=1\neq m-1=0$
- $m$ can't be $1$

iii) If $m$ is composite
- Then, $m$ would have some $d$ such that $d|m$ where $1<d<m$
- But $gcd(d,m)=d>1$
- Then, $\phi(m)\leq m-2$
- Which contradicts $\phi(m)=m-1$
- Thus, $m$ can't be conposite

# Multiplicative
An arithmetic function $f$ is called **multiplicative** if $f(mn)=f(m)f(n)$ whenever $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers
- Arithmetic Funtion means functions defined for all positive integer

And $f$ is **completely multiplicative** if $f(mn)=f(m)f(n)$ for all positive integers $m,n$

# Theorem 7.1
If $f$ is multiplicative function and if $n=p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\dots p_{s}^{a_{s}}$ is the prime factorization of positive integer $n$, then
$$f(n)=f(p_{1}^{a_{1}})\cdot f(p_{2}^{a_{2}})\dots f(p_{s}^{a_{s}})$$

# Theorem 7.2
Let $m\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, then $\phi(m)=m-1$ iff $m$ is prime

# Theorem 7.3
Let $p$ be prime, $k\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, then $\phi(m)=p^{k}-p^{k-1}$

Let $m=p^{k}$ where $p$ is prime, $k$ is an integer $\geq 2$
- Let's count the integers $a:1\leq a\leq p^{k}$ that are not relatively prime to $m$
	- $p, 2p, 3p, \dots p^{k-1}p$
- $\phi(p^{k})=p^{k}-p^{k-1}$

# Theorem 7.4
Let $m,n$ be relatively prime positive integers, then $\phi(mn)=\phi(m)\cdot \phi(n)$

## Rough Work
Consider $\phi(42)$ and $\phi(6)\cdot\phi(7)$
Since $\phi(6)=2$, (1 and 5), Let's consider row 1 and 5 only at the below
- Then, crossout integers that is not relatively prime with 7

**1**   7  **13  19  25  31  37**
2  8  14  20  26  32  38
3  9  15  21  27  33  39
4 10 16  22  28  34  40
**5  11  17  23  29**  35  **41**
6 12 18  24  30  36  42

Consider row $i$
$$i\text{ / } 6+i\text{ / } 2(6)+i\text{ / } 3(6)+i\text{ / } 4(6)+i\text{ / } 5(6)+i\text{ / } 6(6)+i$$
$$=i\text{ / } 6+i \text{ / }12+i\text{ / } 18+i\text{ / } 24+i\text{ / } 30+i\text{ / } 36+i$$
$$\equiv i\text{ / }6+i\text{ / }5+i\text{ / }4+i\text{ / }3+i \text{ / } 2+i\text{ / }1+i\text{ (mod }7)$$

And this is a complete system of residue mod $7$ by [[9. Some Special Congruences#Lemma 4.1|Lemma 4.1]]
- Then, there is a reduced residue system mod $7$ of $\phi(7)$ integers, each relatively prime to $7$

As a result, there are $\phi(6)$ rows that contains some integers that are relatively prime with 42, and in each row, there are $\phi(7)$ integers that are relatively prime with 42

## Formal Proof
Consider following table,

1   $m+1$   $2m+1$   $\dots$   $(n-1)m+1$
2   $m+2$   $2m+2$   $\dots$   $(n-1)m+2$
3   $m+3$   $2m+3$   $\dots$   $(n-1)m+1$
$\vdots$        $\vdots$             $\vdots$                         $\vdots$
$m$     $2m$        $3m$     $\dots$           $nm$

Look at $\phi(m)$ rows where $m$ and $i$ are relatively prime

Consider row $i$, where $gcd(m,i)=1$
 
$$i\text{ / } m+i\text{ / }2m+i\text{ / }\dots\text{ / }(n-1)m+i$$
are all relatively prime to $m$
- Suppose for contradiction, $\exists \text{ }0\leq k\leq n-1$ such that $gcd(km+i, m)=d>1$
- $dx=m$, $dy=km+i$ for some $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$
- Then, $i=d(y-kx)$, thus $d\text{ | }i$
- This contradicts $d\text{ | m}$ and $gcd(m,i)=1$
