Suppose we wich to know if there is some power (depending on $m$) such that $a^{?}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }m)$

Impossible if $a$ and $m$ are not relatively prime
- If $a^{k}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }m)$
	 $my=a^{k}-1$
	 $a^{k}-my=1$
	 $a(a^{k-1})+m(-y)=1$
	 $\therefore gcd(a,m)=1$

Consider a set $A=\{a\text{ | } 1\leq a\leq m \text{ \& }gcd(a,m)=1\}$
- $\phi(m)$

# Euler Phi Function $\phi(m)$
Let $m\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Then Euler Phi Function $\phi(m)$ is defined to be the number of positive integers not exceeding $m$ that are relatively prime to $m$

Ex)
If $m$ is prime, then $\phi(m)=m-1$

Ex)
Suppose we want a power of 7 that is congruent to 1 modulo 10
- $7^{k}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$

Consider $\phi(10)=4 \implies \{1,3,7,9\}$

Multiply each number by 7 $\implies \{7,21,49,63\}$

By taking mod 10 $\implies\{7,1,9,3\}$
- We got the same set again
- Looks like Fermat's Little Theorem

Then, 
$$(7\cdot(1))(7\cdot(3))(7\cdot(7))(7\cdot(9))\equiv 1\cdot 3\cdot 7 \cdot 9\text{ (mod }10)$$
$$7^{4}(1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7) \equiv 1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7\text{ (mod }10)$$
$$7^{4}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$$
It seems liek $7^{\phi(10)}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$

# Theorem 6.14: Euler's Theorem
If $m\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ and $a$ is an integer such that $gcd(a,m)=1$, then
$$a^{\phi(m)}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }m)$$

**Note)**
Since Euler's Theorem consider numbers that are relatively prime with $m$, we can't use complete system of residue, like we did to prove Fermat's Little Theorem. Instead, let's define another system

## Reduced Residue System Modulo $m$
Integers such that each element of the set if relatively prime to $m$ and no two distinct elements in the set are congruent modulo $m$
- Simply is a set of $\phi(m)$
- Start from Complete Residue System and remove element that is not relatively prime with $m$

Ex) 
Consider 6
- Complete Residue System mod 6 : $\{0,1,2,3,4, 5\}$
- Reduced Residue System mod 6 : $\{1,5\}$
