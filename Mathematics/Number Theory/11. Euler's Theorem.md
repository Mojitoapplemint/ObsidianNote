Suppose we wich to know if there is some power (depending on $m$) such that $a^{?}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }m)$

Impossible if $a$ and $m$ are not relatively prime
- If $a^{k}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }m)$
	 $my=a^{k}-1$
	 $a^{k}-my=1$
	 $a(a^{k-1})+m(-y)=1$
	 $\therefore gcd(a,m)=1$

Consider a set $A=\{a\text{ | } 1\leq a\leq m \text{ \& }gcd(a,m)=1\}$
- $\phi(m)$

# Euler Phi Function $\phi(m)$
Let $m\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Then Euler Phi Function $\phi(m)$ is defined to be the number of positive integers not exceeding $m$ that are relatively prime to $m$

Ex)
If $m$ is prime, then $\phi(m)=m-1$

Ex)
Suppose we want a power of 7 that is congruent to 1 modulo 10
- $7^{k}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$

Consider $\phi(10)=4 \implies \{1,3,7,9\}$

Multiply each number by 7 $\implies \{7,21,49,63\}$

By taking mod 10 $\implies\{7,1,9,3\}$
- We got the same set again
- Looks like Fermat's Little Theorem

Then, 
$$(7\cdot(1))(7\cdot(3))(7\cdot(7))(7\cdot(9))\equiv 1\cdot 3\cdot 7 \cdot 9\text{ (mod }10)$$
$$7^{4}(1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7) \equiv 1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7\text{ (mod }10)$$
$$7^{4}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$$
It seems liek $7^{\phi(10)}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$

# Theorem 6.14: Euler's Theorem
If $m\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ and $a$ is an integer such that $gcd(a,m)=1$, then
$$a^{\phi(m)}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }m)$$

**Note)**
Since Euler's Theorem consider numbers that are relatively prime with $m$, we can't use complete system of residue, like we did to prove Fermat's Little Theorem. Instead, let's define another system

## Reduced Residue System Modulo $m$
Integers such that each element of the set if relatively prime to $m$ and no two distinct elements in the set are congruent modulo $m$
- Simply is a set of $\phi(m)$
- Start from Complete Residue System and remove element that is not relatively prime with $m$

Ex) 
Consider 6
- Complete Residue System mod 6 : $\{0,1,2,3,4, 5\}$
- Reduced Residue System mod 6 : $\{1,5\}$

## Proof)
Let $r_{1}, r_{2}\dots r_{\phi(m)}$ be reduced residue system mod $m$ were $r_{i}$ is the least positive residue mod $m$

Let $a$ be an integer such that $gcd(a,m)=1$
- Then, let's show $ar_{1}, ar_{2}, \dots ar_{\phi(m)}$ is a reduced residue system mod $m$

First $gcd(a,m)=1$ by assertion, and $gcd(r_{i}, m)=1$
- Then $gcd(ar_{i}, m)=1$

Suppose $ar_{i}\equiv ar_{j}\text{ (mod }m)$ for some $i\neq j$ and $1\leq i,j\leq\phi(m)$
- So, $m|a(r_{i}-r_{j})$

Since $gcd(a,m)=1$ this means $m|(r_{i}-r_{j})$
- Thus, $r_{i}\equiv r_{j}\text{ (mod }m)$
- But this is a contradiction since $r_{1}, r_{2}\dots r_{\phi(m)}$ is a reduced residue system mod $m$, thus $r_{i}\not\equiv r_{j}\text{ (mod }m)$ where $i\neq j$

So, $ar_{1}, ar_{2}\dots ar_{\phi(m)}$ is a reduced residue system mod $m$

So the least positive integers (mod $m$) of $ar_{1}, ar_{2}, \dots ar_{\phi(m)}$ are $r_{1}, r_{2}\dots r_{\phi(m)}$
- Not necessarily in the same order

Therefore, 
$$(ar_{1})(ar_{2})\dots(ar_{\phi(m)})\equiv r_{1}\cdot r_{2}\dots r_{\phi(m)}\text{ (mod }m)$$
$$a^{\phi(m)}\cdot r_{1}\cdot r_{2}\dots r_{\phi(m)}\equiv r_{1}\cdot r_{2}\dots r_{\phi(m)}\text{ (mod }m)$$
We can cancel $r_{i}$'s since each is relativelt prime to $m$,
$$\therefore  a^{\phi(m)}\equiv 1 \text{ (mod }m)$$
## Example)
Find the least non negative residue of $2^{121}$ mod $9$

So, $a=2$ and $m=9$, then $gcd(a,m)=1$

Then by Euler's Theorem, $2^{\phi(9)}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }9)$

Consider $\phi(9) \to\{1,2,4,5,7,8\}$
- $\phi(9)=6$

Since $121 = 20\cdot{6}+1$, 
- $2^{121} = (2^{6})^{20}\cdot 2\equiv 2\text{ (mod }9)$

## Example 2)
Find least positive residue $x\text{ (mod }10)$ of $3x\equiv 7\text{ (mod }10)$

Let $m=10$ and $a=3$.

Since $gcd(3,10)=1$, then by Euler's Theorem, 
$$3^{\phi(10)}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$$
$\phi(10)=4$ $(\{1,3,7,9\})$
- Thus, $3^{4}\equiv 1\text{ (mod }10)$

This tells use that $3$ and $3^{3}$ are inverses mod $10$
- And $3^{2}$ is its own inverse

Multiply $3^{3}$ to both sides to the equation above
$3^{3}\cdot 3x\equiv 3^{3}\cdot7\text{ (mod }10)$
$3^{4}x\equiv x\equiv 3^{3}\cdot 7=27\cdot7\equiv9 \text{ (mod }m)$

# Chapter 7

# Euler-Phi Function
If $m$ is prime, then $\phi(m)=m-1$

How about its converse?

Suppose $m$ is an positive integer with $\phi(m)=m-1$

i) If $m$ is prime

ii) If $m=1$
- $\phi(1)=1\neq m-1=0$
- $m$ can't be $1$

iii) If $m$ is composite
- Then, $m$ would have some $d$ such that $d|m$ where $1<d<m$
