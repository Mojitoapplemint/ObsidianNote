# Mathematical Statement
A statement is something which can be **assigned a truth value**
- Somethings is either true or false (or we don’t know) 

Ex)
- There are an infinite of prime number (O) 
- “Let x be a real number,” “What is a number?”(X)

## Different Type of Statement
Conjecture
- A statement which we believe to be true, but cannot yet prove 

Lemma -> Proposition -> Theorem
- All types of statements which *have been proven*
- Roughly in increasing order of difficulty and/or important 

Axiom
- A statement that is *assumed to be true*

# Logical Operation
## And( $\wedge$ )
if p and q are statements -> “p n(and) q” which is true if both p and q are true, unless it’s false or unknown (True & Unknown) 

## Or( $\lor$ )
Statements q and p -> “p or(v) q” is true at least one of them are true.
- “p XOR q”: Only true if one of them is true, not both

## Implication( $p\longrightarrow q$  / $p\implies q$)
“$\text{if }p\text{, then }q$" : ( $p\longrightarrow q$ )
“$p\text{ implies }q$” : ( $p\implies q$ )
- **True if whenever p is true, q is also true **
- To show an implication is false, find counter example(p is true, but q is false)
- *The only case it’s false if p is true, but q is false *

If $p$ is always false, then we take "$p\longrightarrow q$" to be true, regardless $q$ is true or false 
- If 0=1, then 1+1=5 : is considered as true 

## If and only if ( "$p\longleftrightarrow q$" "$p\longrightleftarrows q$" "$p\text{ iff }q$")
- True if whenever p is true, q is true, and whenever q is true, then p is true 
- Original statement and its converse are both true 

## Not P ( $\lnot p$ )
true if p is false, and false if p is true 

## Converse
For original statement $p\longrightarrow q$ , its converse statement is $q \longrightarrow p$ 
- Even if the original statement is true, converse can be false or true 

## Contrapositive
Converse + Not
- $p\longrightarrow q\text{ }\implies \text{ }\lnot q\longrightarrow\lnot p$
- *The boolean value of contrapositive is equal to its original statement*
- The contrapositive of “Not statement” is the converse of its original statement

# Prove Methods
## Proof by Cases
- Do different proofs depending different cases

## Proof by contrapositive
Since contrapositive has same true/false value with the original statement, **prove contrapositive to prove the original **

## Proof by contradiction
*Assume what you want to prove is false*, then do some calculations and/or other reasoning to **find something impossible as a result**

# Truth Table
Two statements are logically equivalent if their truth or falsity is exactly same in all cases
- Can do this with Truth Table: Listing all possible values of $p$, $q$ and what the truth value of the compound statements are

| p   | q   | $\lnot q$ | $p\wedge\lnot q$ |
| --- | --- | --------- | ---------------- |
| T   | T   | F         | F                |
| T   | F   | T         | T                |
| F   | T   | F         | F                |
| F   | F   | T         | F                |

# Logical Operation Properties
## deMorgan’s law
$$\lnot(p\wedge q) = \lnot p \lor \lnot q$$
$$\lnot(p\lor q) = \lnot p \wedge \lnot q$$
