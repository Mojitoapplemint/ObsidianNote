# Mathematical Statement
A statement is something which can be **assigned a truth value**
- Somethings is either true or false (or we don’t know) 

Ex)
- There are an infinite of prime number (O) 
- “Let x be a real number,” “What is a number?”(X)

## Different Type of Statement
Conjecture
- A statement which we believe to be true, but cannot yet prove 

Lemma -> Proposition -> Theorem
- All types of statements which *have been proven*
- Roughly in increasing order of difficulty and/or important 

Axiom
- A statement that is *assumed to be true*

# Logical Operation
## And( $\wedge$ )
if p and q are statements -> “p n(and) q” which is true if both p and q are true, unless it’s false or unknown (True & Unknown) 

## Or( $\lor$ )
Statements q and p -> “p or(v) q” is true at least one of them are true.
- “p XOR q”: Only true if one of them is true, not both

## Implication( $p\longrightarrow q$  / $p\implies q$)
“$\text{if }p\text{, then }q$" : ( $p\longrightarrow q$ )
“$p\text{ implies }q$” : ( $p\implies q$ )
- **True if whenever p is true, q is also true **
- To show an implication is false, find counter example(p is true, but q is false)
- *The only case it’s false if p is true, but q is false *

If $p$ is always false, then we take "$p\longrightarrow q$" to be true, regardless $q$ is true or false 
- If 0=1, then 1+1=5 : is considered as true 

## Converse
For original statement $p\longrightarrow q$ , its converse statement is $q \longrightarrow p$ 
- Even if the original statement is true, converse can be false or true 

## If and only if ( "$p\longleftrightarrow q$" or "$p\text{ iff }q$")
- True if whenever p is true, q is true, and whenever q is true, then p is true 
- Original statement and its converse are both true 

## Not P ( $\lnot p$ )
true if p is false, and false if p is true 

# deMorgan’s law
$$\lnot(p\wedge q) = \lnot p \lor \lnot q$$
$$\lnot(p\lor q) = \lnot p \wedge \lnot q$$

ㄱ(p and q) = ㄱp or ㄱq / ㄱ(p or q) = ㄱp and ㄱq
