# Finite Automata
Input: Finite String
- But automata will process each alphabet at a time
Output
- Accept or Reject

Computation Process
1. Begin at start state
2. Read Input symbols
3. Follow Corresponding transitions
4. Accept if ends in accepet state
	- Reject if not

**Ex)**

## Language
The set of all finite strings that the automata accepts is called language

Let $A$ be the language of $M_{1}$. Then 
- $M_{1}$ recognizes $A$
- Denoted as $A=L(M_{1})$

From example above,
$A=\{ w:w\text{ contains substring 11} \}$
