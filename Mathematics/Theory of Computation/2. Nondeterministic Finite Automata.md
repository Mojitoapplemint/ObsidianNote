# Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
Each state has stochastic transition for each symbol in the alphabet
- Note that NFA generalizes DFA, thus every DFA is NFA

A nondeterministic finite automaton $M$ is 5-tuple$\left( Q,\sum, \delta, q_{0}, F \right)$
- $Q$ : Finite set of states
- $\sum$ : Finite set of alphabet symbols
- $\delta$ : Transition function $\delta: Q\times \sum_{\varepsilon}\to \mathcal{P}(Q)$
	- Where $\mathcal{P}(Q)$ is power set
	- $\sum_{\varepsilon}=\sum\cup \{ \varepsilon \}$
- $q_{0}$ : Start state
- $F$ : Set of accept states

## Computation of NFA
After processing all symbols, at least one possibility shuold be in the accepting state.
- Even though we reached accepting state, if we still have unprocessed input and there is no way to process, it's dead end (wrong)

### Formal Definition of Computation
Let $N$ be an NFA and $w=y_{1}\dots y_{m}$ a string over the alphabet $\sum$. Then we say $N$ accepts $w$ if $y_{i}\in \sum_{\varepsilon}$ and a sequence of states $r_{0}, r_{1}\dots r_{m}$ exists in $Q$ with three condition
1. $r_{0}=q_{0}$
2. $r_{i+1}\in\delta(r_{i}, y_{i+1})$ for $i=0,\dots m-1$
3. $r_{m}\in F$

## $\varepsilon$-Transition
Multiple explicit paths from one state to others with the same transition label
- Sometimes it is convenient to permit that an automation transitions without reading an input symbol
- Such tansitions are called $\varepsilon$-transitions, where $\varepsilon$ is the empty word

$M^{\varepsilon}=\left( Q,\sum^{\varepsilon}, \delta^{\varepsilon}, q_{0}, F^{\varepsilon} \right)$
- $\sum^{\varepsilon}=\sum\cup \{ \varepsilon \}$
- $\delta^{\varepsilon}:Q\times \sum^{\varepsilon}\to \mathcal{P}(Q)$

### Computation
Without reading any input, the machine splits into multiple copies, one following each of the existing $\varepsilon$-labeled arrows and one staying at the current state. Then the machine proceeds nondeterministically as before.

## Nondeterminism vs Determinism
Nondeterminism is exponentially more simple than determinism
- Suppose we want to check if the $k^{th}$ leter from the end of the input is 1
	- An NFA can check this with $k+1$ states
	- DFA must remember the $k$most recent input symbols, which means $2^{k}$ states

## Theorem 1.39 : NFA to DFA
For every NFA $N$, there is a DFA $D$ such that $L(N)=L(D)$
- We say that two machines are equivalent if they recognize the same language

### Subset Construction Algorithm
1. Starts with the same initial state
2. Each state is going to be a set of possible transition state from initial state with certain alphabet input
	- Each different set is going to be a new state
3. Repeat the same process for all set
	- If transition leads to set already exist, connect them
	- Otherwise, create a new set 
4. The set that contains accepting state is going to be accepting states for DFA

**Ex)**
Following NFA

is correspondent to following DFA

### Corollary Theorem
A language is regular iff some NFA recognizes it

**Proof)**

$(\to)$ Suppose $A$ is regular language, then there is some DFA $D$ that accepts $A$. Every DFA is NFA, thus true

$(\leftarrow)$ Suppose NFA $N$ recognizes some language $A$. Then by Theorem 1.39, there is equivalent DFA $D$. Since $D$ recognizes $A$, it is regular

## Union of NFA
Can compute union of NFAs using the product construction
- But there is simpler way for union

1. Create a new starting state
2. Create paths from new starting state to starting state to each NFAs with $\varepsilon$ transition

## Concatenation of NFA
Assign $N$’s start state to be the start state of $N_{1}$. The accept states of $N_{1}$ have additional ε arrows that nondeterministically allow branching to $N_{2}$ whenever $N_{1}$ is in an accept state

## Star Operation of NFA
Let $A_{1}$ is regular. Build NFA that accepts $A^{*}_{1}$
- Construct $N$ like $N_{1}$ with additional $\varepsilon$ arrows returning to the start state from the accept states
- Add a new start state, which also is an accept state, and which has an $\varepsilon$ arrow to the old start state

# Complementation
$L^{c}=\sum^{*}/L$

## Drawing DFA for Complementation of $L$
Suppose DFA $M$ accepts language $L$
DFA that accepts the complement of $L$, called $M^{c}$, looks the same to $M$, except switching accepting state to nonaccepting state and vice versa

**Note)** This does not work for NFA

# Regular Operation
Operations on languages
- Union: $A\cup B=\{ x|x\in A\text{ or }x\in B \}$
- Concatenation: $A\circ B=\{ xy\text{ | }x\in A\text{ or }y\in B \}$
- Star: $A^{*}=\{ x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{k}\text{ | }k\geq 0\text{ and each }x_{i}\in A \}$

## Theorem 1.25
The class of regular languages is closed under the union operation
- i.e. If $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are regular languages, so is $A_{1}\cup A_{2}$

**Proof)**
Let
- $M_{1}$ recognize $A_{1}$, where $M_{1}=\left( Q_{1}, \sum_{1}, \delta_{1}, q_{1}, F_{1} \right)$
- $M_{2}$ recognize $A_{2}$, where $M_{2}=\left( Q_{2}, \sum_{2}, \delta_{2}, q_{2}, F_{2} \right)$

Construct $M$ to recognize $A_{1}\cup A_{2}$, where $M=\left( Q, \sum, \delta, q_{0}, F \right)$
1. $Q=\{ (r_{1},r_{2})\text{ | }r_{1}\in Q_{1} \text{ and }r_{2}\in Q_{2}\}$
	- This set is the cartesian product of sets $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$
2. $\sum=\sum_{1}\cup \sum_{2}$
3. $\delta((r_{1},r_{2}), a)=(\delta_{1}(r_{1},a), \delta_{2}(r_{2},a))$
4. $q_{0}=(q_{1},q_{2})$
5. $F$ is the set of pairs in which either member is an accept state of $M_{1}$ or $M_{2}$
$$F=\{ (r_{1},r_{2})\text{ | }r_{1}\in F_{1}\text{ or }r_{2}\in F_{2}\}$$
$$=(F_{1}\times Q_{2})\cup (Q_{1}\times F_{2})$$

**Note)** Section "Union of NFA" also can prove this

## Theorem 1.26
The class of regular languages is closed under the concatenation operation
- i.e. If $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are regular languages, so is $A_{1}\circ A_{2}$

Similar proof with above. Instead of constructing automaton $M$ to accept its input if either $M_{1}$ or $M_{2}$ accept, it must accept if its input can be broken into two pieces, where $M_{1}$ accepts the first piece and $M_{2}$ accepts the second piece

**Note)** Section "Concatenation of NFA" also can prove this

## Theorem 1.49
The class of regular languages is closed under the star operation

**Proof)**
Let $A$ is regular
NFA that accepts $A^{*}$ can be constructed by section "Star  Operation of NFA"
