Series of languages combined with regular operations

e.g. $(0\cup1)0^{*}$
- $0$ and $1$ refers to $\{ 0 \}$, $\{ 1 \}$
	- $(0\cup 1)\implies \{ 0 \}\cup\{ 1 \}=\{ 0,1 \}$
	- $0^{*}=\{ 0 \}^{*}$
- Concatenation ( . ) if often implies
	- $(0\cup1)\text{ . }0^{*}$

# Definition
$R$ is regular expression if $R$ :
- $a$ for some $a\in \sum$
- $\varepsilon$ 
- $\emptyset$ 
- Union of two regular expressions
	- $R_{1}\cup R_{1} =R_{1}|R_{2}$
- Concatenation of regular expressions
- Star operation of regular expression

## Anchors
- `^`: The beginning of the line
- `$`: End of the line

## Matching Operators
- `.`: Any single character, except line break
- `[...]`: Any character in this set
	- Ranges are allow by using `-` and ASCII code
	- `^` for "Not in this set" at the beginning 
- `{...}`: Any String in this set

## Iterations
 Apply to the immediately preceding item(letter or set)
- `*`: Zero or more times
- `+`: One or more times
- `?`: Zero or one time
	- $a? = \{ a \}\cup \{ \varepsilon \}$
- $R^{k}$ : Concatenation of $k$ $R's$ with each other

## Prededence rules
1. $^{*},+,?$ before .
2. "." before $\cup$
3. Parenthesis when needed

$\implies$ Iteration $\to$ Concatenation $\to$ Union

## $\emptyset$ vs $\varepsilon$
$\varepsilon$ is a language containing a single string that is empty string.
$\emptyset$ represents the language that doesn't contain any string


If $R$ is regular expressions, then
1. $R\cup \emptyset =R$
2. $R.\emptyset=\emptyset$
	- $\text{abc}\emptyset=\emptyset$
3. $R.\varepsilon=R$
4. $R\cup\varepsilon=R\cup \{ \varepsilon \}$
	- Just regular expression with empty string added
5. $\emptyset^{*}=\varepsilon$

# Theorem: Regular language and Regular Expression
A language is regular iff some regular expression describes it

## Lemma 1
For every simple language $S$, there is a finite automata $M$ such that $L(M)=S$

**Proof)**
Language $\emptyset$

Language $\{ a \}$

Language $\varepsilon$

## Prove
$(\to)$
If Language is regular, then there is some DFA(NFA) that accepts it
- We can convert NFA to regular expression, describe below

Therefore, if a language is regular, then there is regular expression that describe it

$(\leftarrow)$
Suppose regular expression $R$ describes some language $A$
- We are going to build NFA that accepts $A$
- By Corolarry 1.40, $A$ must be regular

By Lemma 1, we know that there is NFA for $\emptyset, \varepsilon$ and $\forall \text{ } a\in \sum$

For concatenation, union, star, we can construct NFA from previous chapter

# Finite Automata to Regular Expression
## Generalized Nondeterministic Finite Automata (GNFA)
NFA wherein the transition arrows may have any regular expressions as labels
- Transition by reading a substring described by regex
- Accepts input if its processing can cause GNFA to be in an accept state at the end of the input

GNFA always satisfys certain condition for convenience
1. The start state has no arrows coming in from any other state. 
2. There is only a single accept state, and it has no arrows going to any other state.
	- The accept state is not the same as the start state
3. Except for the start and accept states, one arrow goes from every state to every other state and also from each state to itself
	- If there is no arrow between some two states, we assume that there is $\emptyset$

### Formal Definition
A generalized nondeterministic finite automaton is a 5-tuple,$(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{\text{start}}, q_{\text{accept}})$, where  
- $Q$ is the finite set of states
-  $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet
- $\delta: (Q - \{q_{\text{accept}}\}) \times (Q - \{q_{\text{start}}\}) \to \mathcal{R}$ is the transition function
- $q_{\text{start}}$ is the start state
- $q_{\text{accept}}$ is the accept state.

### Computation

A GNFA accepts a string $w$ in $\Sigma^*$ if $w = w_1 w_2 \cdots w_k$, where each $w_i$ is in $\Sigma^*$ and a sequence of states $q_0, q_1, \dots, q_k$ exists such that 
- $q_0 = q_{\text{start}}$ is the start state 
- $q_k = q_{\text{accept}}$ is the accept state
- For each $i$, we have $w_i \in L(R_i)$, where $R_i = \delta(q_{i-1}, q_i)$
	- i.e.$R_i$ is the expression on the arrow from $q_{i-1}$ to $q_i$

## Steps
4. Create a unique initial state and final state by $\varepsilon$ transition
5. Choose one state rip it
	- Consider the paths 
		- Input state $\xrightarrow{\text{Incoming}}$ chosen state $\xrightarrow{\text{Outgoing}}$ output state
	- Find incoming transition, self loop and outgoing transition of the path
		- If there is no self loop, we consider self loop of $\emptyset$, since $\emptyset^{*}=\varepsilon$
	- Write regular language that represents each path
		- $\text{(Incoming)(Loop)}^{*}\text{(Outgoing)}$
	- This means that each language would represent the transition between input and output state
6. Remove the chosen state from state transition diagram and add the new transition created from 2
	- If the transition from input state to output state already exists, union them


# State Equivalence
Given an FA $M=\left( Q, \sum, \delta, q_{0}, F \right)$ and a state $r$ in $M$, we write $M_{r}$ for the FA that results by changing the initial state, $q_{0}$ to $r$
- $M_{r}=\left( Q, \sum, \delta, r, F \right)$

We say two states $p$ and $r$ are equivalent, denoted $p\sim_{M}r$ iff $L(M_{p})=L(M_{r})$. for state $q\in Q$, the equivalence class is defined as $[q]_{\sim M}=\{ p\in Q \text{ | }p\sim_{M} q\}$
- If automata started from equivalent states, the automata will accept and reject the same words

## Quotient Automaton

## Minimization Algorithm
Two states are dinstinguishable if they are not equivalent

Formally, two states $p$ and $r$ are distinguishable, if there exists a word $w\in \sum^{*}$ such that exactly one of $\delta(p,w)$ and $\delta(r,w)$ is an accepting state

Table-filling algorithm
1. Draw a table for all pairs of states $(p,r)\in Q\times Q$
2. Mark all pairs where $p\in F$ and $r\not\in F$
3. If there are any unmarked pairs ...
