Automata Theory deals with the definitions and properties of mathematical models of computation

# Vocabularies
Alphabet ($\sum$)
- Any nonempty finite set

Symbols
- Elements of the alphabet

String over an alphabet
- Finite sequence of symbols from that alphabet
	- $\sum^{k}$ ($k\geq\mathbb{Z}^{+}$) : Set of all strings with length $k$
	- $\sum^{*}$ : Set of all strings over alphabet
	- $\sum^{+}$ : Set of all strings with length at least 1
		- $\sum-\{ \varepsilon \}$
- Length of the string refers to number of symbols in it

Empty String ($\varepsilon$)
- String with length 0

Reverse of $w$ ($w^{\mathcal{R}}$)
- Obtained by writing $w$ in reverse order

Concatenation
- Concatenation of $x$ and $y$, denoted as $xy$, is appending $y$ after $x$

Lexicographic
- i.e. Dictionary Order
- Shortlex Order(String order) : lexicographic order + shorter string firsts

Language
- Set of strings chosen from $\sum^{*}$
- If $\sum$ is an alphabet and $L\subseteq \sum^{*}$, then we say $L$ is a language over $\sum$

# Formal Definition of Finite Automata
A finite automaton $M$ is 5-tuple$\left( Q,\sum, \delta, q_{0}, F \right)$
- $Q$ : Finite set of states
- $\sum$ : Finite set of alphabet symbols
- $\delta$ : Transition function $\delta: Q\times \sum\to Q$
- $q_{0}$ : Start state
- $F$ : Set of accept states

**Ex above)**
$M_{1}:\left( Q,\sum,\delta,q_{0},F \right)$
$Q:\{ q_{0},q_{1},q_{2} \}$
$\sum:\{ 0,1 \}$
$F:\{ q_{2} \}$

| $\delta=$ | 0       | 1       |
| --------- | ------- | ------- |
| $q_{0}$   | $q_{0}$ | $q_{1}$ |
| $q_{1}$   | $q_{0}$ | $q_{2}$ |
| $q_{2}$   | $q_{2}$ | $q_{2}$ |
## Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA)
Finite Automaton that for every symbol of an input string read, we will always *know what the next state* will be
- The next state is determined

# Computation of DFA
## Computation Process
1. Begin at start state
2. Read Input symbols
3. Follow Corresponding transitions
4. Accept if ends in accepet state
	- Reject if not

## I/O
Input: Finite String
- But automata will process each alphabet at a time
Output
- Accept or Reject

## Formal Definition of Computation
Let $M=\left( Q, \sum, \delta, q_{0}, F \right)$ be a Finite Automaton and let $w=w_{1}w_{2}\dots{w}_{n}$ be a string where each $w_{i}\in \sum$. Then $M$ accepts $w$ if a sequence of states $r_{0},r_{1}\dots r_{n}$ exists with three conditions
1. $r_{0}=q_{0}$
2. $\delta(r_{i}, w_{i+1})=r_{i+1}$, for $i=0,1,2,\dots n-1$
3. $r_{n}\in F$

Condition 1 forces the machine starts in the start state
Condition 2 says that all state transition that machine made is according to the transition funciton
Condition 3 says that machine accepts its input iff it ends up in an accept state

## Language
If $A=\{ w\text{ | } M \text{ accepts } w\}$, then we say that
- $M$ recognizes $A$
- $A$ is language of $M$
	- Denoted as $A=L(M)$

### Regular Language
- A language recognized by some finite automata

**Ex)**
![[Pasted image 20250107230029.png|400]]
$A=\{ w:w\text{ contains substring 11} \}$

**Ex)** Is $\sum^{*}$ regular?
- Yes, is there is single state with self loop for $\sum$

# How to Construct Finite Automaton from its Language


---
## Example
1. $\{ w:\text{ There is odd number of occurence of 0 in }w \}$
2. $\{ w:w \text{ starts and ends with the same symbol} \}$
