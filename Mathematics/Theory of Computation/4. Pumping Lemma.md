We need a tool to detect that certain language is not regular

# Pumping
Pumping is repeating a section of the word an aribtrary number of times, where the resulting word is still in the language
- For word $w=xyz$, we can pump $w$ by forming the set of strings $xy^{i}z, i\geq 0$
- Since pumping $y=\varepsilon$ will not change the word, $y$ cannot be $\varepsilon$

Normally we say that a string is pumpable with respect to a specific language since without looking at a specific language, every nonempty string is pumpable

## Pumping Length
Pumping Length: All words in the language can be pumped if they are at least as long as certain special valued called the pumping length

# Pumpable Strings and Regular Language
All infinite regular languages contain one more more st

# Pumping Lemma
If $L$ is regular language, then there is a number $p$ (pumping length) where if $w$ is any word in $L$ of length at least $p$, then $w$ may be divided into three pieces $w=xyz$ where
- For each $i\geq0\text{, }xy^{i}z\in L$
- $|y|>0$
- $|xy|\leq p$

In other word,
For every regular language $L$, there exists a number $p\geq 1$ such that 
for every word $w\in L$, with at least $p$ letters, there exists $x,y,z$ with $w=xyz$ and $|y|>0$ and $|xy|\leq p$ such that for every number $i\geq0$, $xy^{i}z\in L$

## Proving $L$ is not regular


## Example 1)
Can we draw FA that accept this : $L=\{ 0^{m}1^{n}\text{ | }m=n \}$?
- Show that pumping lemma does not hold

Suppose for contradiction, $L$ is regular language. 

Consider any pumping number $p\geq 1$
- Let $w=0^{p}1^{p}$ and let $x=0^{a}$, $y=0^{b}$, and $z=0^{p-a-b}1^{p}$ for $b\geq 1$

Consider $\bar{w}=0^{a}(0^{b})^{i}0^{p-a-b}1^{p}$
- We need to find some $i\geq 0$ that $\bar{w}\not\in L$

Let $i=2$, then $\bar{w}=0^{a}(0^{b})^{2}0^{p-a-b}1^{p}=\bar{w}=0^{a}0^{2b}0^{p-a-b}1^{p}=0^{p+b}1^{p}$
- Since $b\geq 1$, $\bar{w}\not\in L$

## Example 2)
Show that $\{ xx\text{ | }x\in \{ 0,1 \}^{*} \}$

Choose pumping value $p\geq 1$
- Let $w=10^{p}10^{p}$

Let $x=10^{a}$, $y=0^{b}$ and $z=0^{p-a-b}10^{p}$ for $b\geq 1$

For $i=2$, $\bar{w}=xy^{2}z=10^{a}0^{2b}0^{p-a-b}10^{p}=10^{p+b}10^{p}$
- Since $b\geq 1$, $p+b\neq p$, thus $\bar{w}\not\in L$
