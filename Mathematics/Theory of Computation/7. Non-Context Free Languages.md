# Pumping Lemma for CFG
If $A$ is a context-free language, then there is a number $p$ (the pumping length) where, if $s$ is any string in $A$ of length at least $p$, then $s$ may be divided into five pieces $s = uvxyz$ satisfying the conditions  
1. for each $i \geq 0$, $uv^i xy^iz \in A$
2. $|vy| > 0$
	- Either $v$ or $y$ is not the empty string
3. $|vxy| \leq p$
	- Pieces $v,x$ and $y$ together hae length at most $p$

Any sufficiently long string $s$ in $A$ can be pumped and remain in $A$

**Proof)**
Let $A$ be a CFL and $G$ be a CFG that generates it
- Let $s$ be very long string in $A$

Consider the parse tree for $s$
