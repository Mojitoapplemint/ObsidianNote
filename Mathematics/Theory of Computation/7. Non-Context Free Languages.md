# Pumping Lemma for CFG
If $A$ is a context-free language, then there is a number $p$ (the pumping length) where, if $s$ is any string in $A$ of length at least $p$, then $s$ may be divided into five pieces $s = uvxyz$ satisfying the conditions  
1. for each $i \geq 0$, $uv^i xy^iz \in A$
2. $|vy| > 0$
3. $|vxy| \leq p$
