Let $C$ be a class of machines with input alphabet $\Sigma$

# Class of Decidability Problem
## Membership $A_{C}$
$$A_{C}=\{ \langle M,w \rangle \text \,|\,M\in C\text{ and }w\in L(M)\}$$
Given FA $M$ (or CFG $G$) and a word $w$, is $w\in L(M)$ (or $w\in L(G)$)?

## Emptiness $E_{C}$
$$E_{C}=\{ \langle M \rangle \text \,|\,M\in C\text{ and }L(M)=\emptyset\}$$
Given FA $M$ (or FCG $G$, or PDA $A$), is $L(M)=\emptyset$ (or $L(G)=\emptyset$ or $L(A)=\emptyset$)?

## Universality $U_{C}$
$$E_{C}=\{ \langle M \rangle \text \,|\,M\in C\text{ and }L(M)=\Sigma^{*}\}$$
Given FA $M$ (or FCG $G$), is $L(M)=\Sigma^{*}$ (or $L(G)=\Sigma^{*}$)?
- We don't know how to do this for CFG

## Equivalence $EQ_{C}$
$$EQ_{C}=\{ \langle M_{1},M_{2} \rangle \text \,|\,M_{1}, M_{2}\in C\text{ and }L(M_{1})=L(M_{2})\}$$
Given two FA $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, is $L(M_{1})=L(M_{2})$?
Given two CFG $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$, is $L(G_{1})=L(G_{2})$?
- We don't know how to do this

# Examples of Recursive Problem
We can construct TM that decide the following languages
- $A_{DFA}$
- $A_{NFA}$
- $A_{REX}$
- $E_{DFA}$
- $EQ_{DFA}$
- $A_{CFG}$
- $E_{CFG}$

## Theorem: $A_{DFA}$ is recursive language
Present a TM $M$ that decides $A$.

$M =$"On input $\langle B, w \rangle$", where $B$ is a DFA and $w$ is a string.

1. Simulate $B$ on input $w$.
2. If the simulation ends in an accept state, accept; if it ends in a non-accepting state, reject

**Proof)**
To represent $B$, simply list its components $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ on the tape.
1. $M$ tracks $B$'s current state and position within $w$ using markings on the tape.
2. $B$'s initial state is $q_0$ and initial position is the leftmost symbol of $w$.
3. States and positions are updated according to $\delta$.
4. After $M$ finishes last symbol of $w$, $M$ accepts the input if $B$ is in an accepting state. $M$ rejects the input if $B$ is in a non-accepting state.

Hence, $A_{DFA}$ is decidable.

# Undecidability
## Examples of Undecidable Problem
$HALT_{TM}=\{ \langle M,w \rangle \text{ | } M\text{ is a TM and }M\text{ halts on input }w\}$

$E_{TM}=\{ \langle M \rangle \text{ | }M\text{ is a TM and }L(M)=\emptyset\}$

$\text{REGULAR}_{TM}=\{ \langle M \rangle \text{ | }M\text{ is a TM and }L(M)\text{ is a regular language} \}$

$EQ_{TM}=\{ \langle M_{1}, M_{2} \rangle \text{ | } M_{1}\text{ and }M_{2}\text{ are TMs and }L(M_{1})=L(M_{2}) \}$

## Theorem: $A_{TM}$ is undecidable

**Proof)**
Suppose for contradiction, $A_{TM}$ is decidable

Suppose $H$ is a decider for $A_{TM}$. On input $\langle M,w \rangle$ where $M$ is a TM and $w$ is a string. $H$ halts and accepts if $M$ accepts $w$. Furthermore, $H$ halts and rejects if $M$ fails to accept $w$

New TM $D$ with $H$ as subroutine

$D$="On input $\langle M \rangle$, where $M$ is a TM"
1. Run $H$ on input $\langle M, \langle M \rangle\rangle$
2. Output the opposite of what $H$ outputs
	- If $H$ accetps, reject, if $H$ rejects, accept

Give $\langle D \rangle$ to $D$ as input, then
$\begin{cases}\textit{accept}\quad\text{if D does not accept }\langle D \rangle \\ \textit{reject}\quad\text{if D accept }\langle D \rangle \\ \end{cases}$

This indicates that $D$ rejects $\langle D \rangle$ when $D$ accepts $\langle D \rangle$
- Which is a contradiction

# Proving Undecidability via Reduction
A reduction is a way of converting one problem to another problem in such a way that a solution to the second can be used to solve the first problem

If $A$ reduces to $B$ and $B$ is decidable, then $A$ is decidable

If $A$ reduces to $B$ and $A$ is undecidable, then $B$ is undecidable

## Reducibility proofs
Given some language $A$ is undecidable, prove that $B$ is undecidable
1. Assume that $B$ is decidable
2. Reduces $A$ to $B$
	- Construct some machine that uses $B$ to solve $A$
3. If $A$ is undecidable, then this is a contradiction, thus $B$ is undecidable

## Theorem : $HALT_{TM}$ is undecidable

**Proof)**
Suppose for contradiction
