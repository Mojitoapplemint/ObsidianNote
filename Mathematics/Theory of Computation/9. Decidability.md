Let $C$ be a class of machines with input alphabet $\Sigma$

# Class of Decidability Problem
## Membership $A_{C}$
$$A_{C}=\{ \langle M,w \rangle \text \,|\,M\in C\text{ and }w\in L(M)\}$$
Given FA $M$ (or CFG $G$) and a word $w$, is $w\in L(M)$ (or $w\in L(G)$)?

## Emptiness $E_{C}$
$$E_{C}=\{ \langle M \rangle \text \,|\,M\in C\text{ and }L(M)=\emptyset\}$$
Given FA $M$ (or FCG $G$, or PDA $A$), is $L(M)=\emptyset$ (or $L(G)=\emptyset$ or $L(A)=\emptyset$)?

## Universality $U_{C}$
$$E_{C}=\{ \langle M \rangle \text \,|\,M\in C\text{ and }L(M)=\Sigma^{*}\}$$
Given FA $M$ (or FCG $G$), is $L(M)=\Sigma^{*}$ (or $L(G)=\Sigma^{*}$)?
- We don't know how to do this for CFG

## Equivalence $EQ_{C}$
$$EQ_{C}=\{ \langle M_{1},M_{2} \rangle \text \,|\,M_{1}, M_{2}\in C\text{ and }L(M_{1})=L(M_{2})\}$$
Given two FA $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, is $L(M_{1})=L(M_{2})$?
Given two CFG $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$, is $L(G_{1})=L(G_{2})$?
- We don't know how to do this

# Examples of Recursive Problem
We can construct TM that decide the following languages
- $A_{DFA}$
- $A_{NFA}$
- $A_{REX}$
- $E_{DFA}$
- $EQ_{DFA}$
- $A_{CFG}$
- $E_{CFG}$

## Theorem: $A_{DFA}$ is recursive language
Present a TM $M$ that decides $A$.

$M =$"On input $\langle B, w \rangle$", where $B$ is a DFA and $w$ is a string.

1. Simulate $B$ on input $w$.
2. If the simulation ends in an accept state, accept; if it ends in a non-accepting state, reject

**Proof)**
To represent $B$, simply list its components $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ on the tape.
1. $M$ tracks $B$'s current state and position within $w$ using markings on the tape.
2. $B$'s initial state is $q_0$ and initial position is the leftmost symbol of $w$.
3. States and positions are updated according to $\delta$.
4. After $M$ finishes last symbol of $w$, $M$ accepts the input if $B$ is in an accepting state. $M$ rejects the input if $B$ is in a non-accepting state.

Hence, $A_{DFA}$ is decidable.

# Undecidability
## Theorem 4.11 
$A_{TM}$ is undecidable

**Proof)**
Suppose for contradiction, $A_{TM}$ is decidable

Suppose $H$ is a decider for $A_{TM}$. On input $\langle M,w \rangle$ where $M$ is a TM and $w$ is a string. $H$ halts and accepts if $M$ accepts $w$. Furthermore, $H$ halts and rejects if $M$ fails to accept $w$

New TM $D$ with $H$ as subroutine
