Demonstrate certain problems that can be solved algorithmically and others that cannot
- Explore the limits of algorithmic solvability
- Study unsolvability

Let $C$ be a class of machines with input alphabet $\Sigma$

# Class of Decidability Problem
## Membership $A_{C}$
$$A_{C}=\{ \langle M,w \rangle \text \,|\,M\in C\text{ and }w\in L(M)\}$$
Given FA $M$ (or CFG $G$) and a word $w$, is $w\in L(M)$ (or $w\in L(G)$)?

## Emptiness $E_{C}$
$$E_{C}=\{ \langle M \rangle \text \,|\,M\in C\text{ and }L(M)=\emptyset\}$$
Given FA $M$ (or FCG $G$, or PDA $A$), is $L(M)=\emptyset$ (or $L(G)=\emptyset$ or $L(A)=\emptyset$)?

## Universality $U_{C}$
$$E_{C}=\{ \langle M \rangle \text \,|\,M\in C\text{ and }L(M)=\Sigma^{*}\}$$
Given FA $M$ (or FCG $G$), is $L(M)=\Sigma^{*}$ (or $L(G)=\Sigma^{*}$)?
- We don't know how to do this for CFG

## Equivalence $EQ_{C}$
$$EQ_{C}=\{ \langle M_{1},M_{2} \rangle \text \,|\,M_{1}, M_{2}\in C\text{ and }L(M_{1})=L(M_{2})\}$$
Given two FA $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, is $L(M_{1})=L(M_{2})$?
Given two CFG $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$, is $L(G_{1})=L(G_{2})$?
- We don't know how to do this
