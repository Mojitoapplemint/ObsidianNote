NFA with Stack
- PDA can push symbols on the stack and pop them later
- Stack can hold unlimited amount of information
	- Allows PDA to store number os unbounded size

# Formal Definition of PDA
A pushdown automaton is a 6-tuple $\left( Q,\sum,\Gamma,\delta,q_{0},F \right)$ where $Q,\sum,\Gamma,F$ are all finite set
- $Q$ is the set of states
- $\sum$ is the input alphabet
- $\Gamma$ is the stack alphabet
- $\delta:Q\times\sum_{\varepsilon}\times\Gamma_{\varepsilon}\longrightarrow \mathcal{P}(Q\times\Gamma_{\varepsilon})$
- $q_{0}\in Q$ is the start state
- $F\subseteq Q$ is the set of accept states
