NFA with Stack
- PDA can push symbols on the stack and pop them later
- Stack can hold unlimited amount of information
	- Allows PDA to store number os unbounded size

# State Transition in PDA
PDA reads input, pop symbols from stack, and push symbol to the stack for each state transition.

![[Pasted image 20250219215916.png|250]]
- $a$ : Reading input
- $b$ : Pop and read symbol from the stack
- $c$ : Push a new symbol to the stack

Transition occurs only when PDA can read $a$ and pop $b$. Otherwise, transition will not happen
- All $a,b,c$ can be $\varepsilon$
# Formal Definition of PDA
A pushdown automaton is a 6-tuple $\left( Q,\sum,\Gamma,\delta,q_{0},F \right)$ where $Q,\sum,\Gamma,F$ are all finite set
- $Q$ is the set of states
- $\sum$ is the input alphabet
- $\Gamma$ is the stack alphabet
- $\delta:Q\times\sum_{\varepsilon}\times\Gamma_{\varepsilon}\longrightarrow \mathcal{P}(Q\times\Gamma_{\varepsilon})$
- $q_{0}\in Q$ is the start state
- $F\subseteq Q$ is the set of accept states

## Transition Function
Domain : $Q\times\sum_{\varepsilon}\times\Gamma_{\varepsilon}$
- Current state, input symbol, and top of the stack will determine the next state
- If either symbol is $\varepsilon$, it is not reading anything

Range : $\mathcal{P}(Q\times\Gamma_{\varepsilon})$
- The result of state transition may allow PDA to enter a new state and push a symbol
- Due to the nondeterminism, a situation may have several legal next moves

## Computation of PDA
PDA $M$ accepts input $w$ if $w$ can be written as $w=w_{1}w_{2}\dots w_{m}$ where each $w_{i}\in \sum_{\varepsilon}$ and sequences of states $r_{0}, r_{1}\dots r_{m}\in Q$ and strings $s_{0},s_{1}\dots s_{m}\in\Gamma^{*}$ exist that satisfy the following three conditions
1. $r_{0}=q_{0}$ and $s_{0}=\varepsilon$
	- Signifies that $M$ starts out properly in the start state and with an empty sta
2. For $i=0\dots m-1$, we have $(r_{i+1}, b)\in\delta(r_{i}, w_{i+1}, a)$ where $s_{i}=at$ and $s_{i+1}=bt$ for some $a,b\in\Gamma_{\varepsilon}$ and $t\in\Gamma^{*}$
	- States that $M$ moves properly according to the state, stack and next input symbol
3. $r_{m}\in F$
	- Accepts state occurs at the input end
# Using $
Using $, we can test empty stack
- Push $ to the stack at first
- If PDA sees $ ever again, it knows that the stack is empty

This also allows PDA to test whether it reached the end of the input string

## $L=\{ 0^{n}1^{n}\text{ | }n\geq 0 \}$

# Equivalence with CFG : A language is context free iff some PDA recognizes it
Both CFG and PDA are caple of describing the class of CFL
- CFG can generate CFL
- PDA can recognizes CFL

This means that we can use both to prove that certain language is context free
- Note that certain language is more easily described in terms of generators, whereas others are more easily described by recognizers

## Lemma 2.21 : If a language is context free, then some PDA recognizes it
Let $A$ be CFL, then by definition, there is some CFG $G$ that generates $A$
- Let's convert $G$ into an equivalent PDA, $P$

Informal description of $P$
1. Place the marker symbol $ and the start variable on the stack. 
2. Repeat the following steps forever.
	1. If the top of stack is a variable symbol $A$, nondeterministically select one of the rules for $A$ and substitute $A$ by the string on the right-hand side of the rule. 
	2. If the top of stack is a terminal symbol $a$, read the next symbol from the input and compare it to $a$. If they match, repeat. If they do not match, reject on this branch of the nondeterminism.
	3. If the top of stack is the symbol $, enter the accept state. Doing so accepts the input if it has all been read.

Let $P=\left( Q,\sum,\Gamma,\delta,q_{\text{start}}, F \right)$

$Q=\{ q_{\text{start}}, q_{\text{loop}}, q_{\text{accept}} \}\cup E$ 
- $E$ is set of helper states

$\delta$ : Replaces variable into right hand side & compares terminals with input and cancels them out
- Initially, we put $ and start variable $S$ to the stack
	- $\delta(q_{\text{start}}, \varepsilon,\varepsilon)=\{ (q_{\text{loop}}, S\$) \}$
- For rule $A\to w$ where $A$ is some variable and $w$ contains both terminal and/or variable
	- Add loop : $\delta(q_{\text{loop}}, \varepsilon, A)=\{ (q_{\text{loop}}, w)\}$
- For rule $A\to a$ where $a$ is terminal
	- Here, this will compare the next input symbol with $a$. If match, PDA cancels them by pushing $\varepsilon$
	- Add loop $\delta(q_{\text{loop}}, a, a)=\{ (q_{\text{loop}}, \varepsilon) \}$
- If stack reaches $, PDA goes to accepting state
	- $\delta(q_{\text{loop}}, \varepsilon, \$)=\{ (q_{\text{accept}}, \varepsilon) \}$

Now let's consider $E$
Suppose we want the PDA go from state $q$ to $r$ when it reads $a\in\sum$, pops $s\in\Gamma$, and push the entire string $u=u_{1}u_{2}\dots u_{l}$
- We can do this by introducing new states $q_{1},q_{2}\dots q_{l-1}$ and transition function
$$\begin{aligned}
&\delta(q,a,s)\text{ to contain } (q_{1}, u_{l})\\ 
&\delta(q_{1}, \varepsilon,\varepsilon)=\{ (q_{2}, u_{l-1}) \}\\
&\quad\quad\quad\vdots\\
&\delta(q_{l-1}, \varepsilon,\varepsilon)=\{ (r, u_{l}) \}
\end{aligned}$$

## Lemma 2.27 : If a PDA recognizes some language, it is context free
**Idea)**
For each pair of states $p$ and $q$ in $P$, the grammar will have a variable $A_{pq}$.
- This variable generates all strings that can take $P$ from $p$ to $q$, without stack change before and after

Modifying $P$ to simplify the task
1. $P$ has single accept state
2. $P$ empties its stack before accepting
3. Each transition either pushes or pops, but not do both at the same time
	- Replace transition that pushes and pops together with two transition sequence
	- Replace transition that neither pushes nor pops with two transition sequence that pushes and pops dummy symbol
	- The first move must be a push and the last move must be a pop

Let $x$ be some string input. Then there are two different possibilities during computation

i) Initially pushed symbol will be popped at the end of $x$
- The stack would never be empty during the computation
- Simulate this with $A_{pq}\to aA_{rs}b$
	- Where $a$ is input read at the first move
	- $b$ is input read at the last move
	- $r$ is state following $p$, $s$ is state preceding $q$

ii) Initially pushed symbol will be popped some point before the end of $x$
- Stack will be empty at this point
- Simulate this with $A_{pq}\to A_{pr}A_{rq}$
	- Where $r$ is the point when the stack becomes empty

**Proof)**
Say that $P = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, \{q_{\text{accept}}\})$ and construct $G$. The variables of $G$ are $\{A_{pq} \mid p, q \in Q\}$. The start variable is $A_{q_0, q_{\text{accept}}}$. Now we describe $G$'s rules in three parts.
1. For each $p, q, r, s \in Q$, $u \in \Gamma$, and $a, b \in \Sigma_\varepsilon$, if $\delta(p, a, \varepsilon)$ contains $(r, u)$ and $\delta(s, b, u)$ contains $(q, \varepsilon)$, put the rule $A_{pq} \to a A_{rs} b$ in $G$.
2. For each $p, q, r \in Q$, put the rule $A_{pq} \to A_{pr} A_{rq}$ in $G$.
3. Finally, for each $p \in Q$, put the rule $A_{pp} \to \varepsilon$ in $G$.

State Transition for 1
$$p\xrightarrow{a,\varepsilon\to u}r\dots s\xrightarrow{b,u\to\varepsilon}q$$
- Observe that the stack doesn't change between at $p$ and at $q$

Now we need to prove that $A_{pq}$ generates $x$ iff $x$ can bring $P$ from $p$ with empty stack to $q$ with empty stack

### If $A_{pq}$ generates $x$, then $x$ can bring $P$ from $p$ with empty stack to $q$ with empty stack
Proof by Induction on the number of steps in the derivation of $x$ from $A_{pq}$
