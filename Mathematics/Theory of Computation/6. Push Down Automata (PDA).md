NFA with Stack
- PDA can push symbols on the stack and pop them later
- Stack can hold unlimited amount of information
	- Allows PDA to store number os unbounded size

# State Transition in PDA
PDA reads input, pop symbols from stack, and push symbol to the stack for each state transition.

- $a$ : Reading input
- $b$ : Pop and read symbol from the stack
- $c$ : Push a new symbol to the stack

Transition occurs only when PDA can read $a$ and pop $b$. Otherwise, transition will not happen
- All $a,b,c$ can be $\varepsilon$
# Formal Definition of PDA
A pushdown automaton is a 6-tuple $\left( Q,\sum,\Gamma,\delta,q_{0},F \right)$ where $Q,\sum,\Gamma,F$ are all finite set
- $Q$ is the set of states
- $\sum$ is the input alphabet
- $\Gamma$ is the stack alphabet
- $\delta:Q\times\sum_{\varepsilon}\times\Gamma_{\varepsilon}\longrightarrow \mathcal{P}(Q\times\Gamma_{\varepsilon})$
- $q_{0}\in Q$ is the start state
- $F\subseteq Q$ is the set of accept states

## Transition Function
Domain : $Q\times\sum_{\varepsilon}\times\Gamma_{\varepsilon}$
- Current state, input symbol, and top of the stack will determine the next state
- If either symbol is $\varepsilon$, it is not reading anything

Range : $\mathcal{P}(Q\times\Gamma_{\varepsilon})$
- The result of state transition may allow PDA to enter a new state and push a symbol
- Due to the nondeterminism, a situation may have several legal next moves

## Computation of PDA
PDA $M$ accepts input $w$ if $w$ can be written as $w=w_{1}w_{2}\dots w_{m}$ where each $w_{i}\in \sum_{\varepsilon}$ and sequences of states $r_{0}, r_{1}\dots r_{m}\in Q$ and strings $s_{0},s_{1}\dots s_{m}\in\Gamma^{*}$ exist that satisfy the following three conditions
1. $r_{0}=q_{0}$ and $s_{0}=\varepsilon$
	- Signifies that $M$ starts out properly in the start state and with an empty sta
2. For $i=0\dots m-1$, we have $(r_{i+1}, b)\in\delta(r_{i}, w_{i+1}, a)$ where $s_{i}=at$ and $s_{i+1}=bt$ for some $a,b\in\Gamma_{\varepsilon}$ and $t\in\Gamma^{*}$
	- States that $M$ moves properly according to the state, stack and next input symbol
3. $r_{m}\in F$
	- Accepts state occurs at the input end

# Example : $L=\{ 0^{n}1^{n}\text{ | }n\geq 0 \}$
