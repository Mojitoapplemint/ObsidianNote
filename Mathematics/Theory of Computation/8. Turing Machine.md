# Formal Definition
A Turing machine is a 7-tuple, $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{\text{accept}}, q_{\text{reject}})$, where $Q, \Sigma, \Gamma$ are all finite sets and
1. $Q$ is the set of states
2. $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet *not containing* the blank symbol $\sqcup$
3. $\Gamma$ is the tape alphabet, where $\sqcup \in \Gamma$ and $\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma$
4. $\delta: Q \times \Gamma \longrightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\}$ is the transition function
5. $q_0 \in Q$ is the start state
6. $q_{\text{accept}} \in Q$ is the accept state, and  
7. $q_{\text{reject}} \in Q$ is the reject state, where $q_{\text{reject}} \neq q_{\text{accept}}$.

## Transition Function
Input: $Q\times\Gamma$ 
- The current state and tape content that is read

Output: $Q\times\Gamma \times \{ L,R \}$
- The next state, new input to write and direction to transition(left and right)

# Computation
1. $M$ receives int input $w=w_{1}w_{2}\dots w_{n}\in \sum^{*}$ on the leftmost $n$ squares of the tape, and rest is blank
	- The head starts on the leftmost square of the tape
	- Since $\sqcup\not\in \sum^{*}$, the first blank appears after the end of the input
2. The computation proceeds according to the rules described by the transition function
	- If it tries to move left from the left-hand end of tape, stays at the first position
3. It halts if it enters either the accept of reject states
	- If neither occurs, it goes forever

## Configuration
During computation, followings change
1. Current state
2. Current tape contents
3. Current head location

Setting of these items is called configuration
- For $q\in Q$, $u,v\in\Gamma$, $u\,q\,v$ represents configuration where current state is $q$, current tape content is $uv$ and the current head location is the first symbol of $v$

Configuration $C_{1}$ **yields** configuration $C_{2}$ if TM can legally go from $C_{1}$ to $C_{2}$ in a single step

For $a,b,c\in\Gamma$, $u,v\in\Gamma^{*}$, and $q_{i}, q_{j}\in Q$ ($ua\,q_{i}\, bv$ and $u\,q_{j}\, acv$ are configurations)
1. $ua\,q_{i}\, bv$ yields $u\,q_{j}\,acv$ if $\delta(q_{i}, b)=(q_{j}, c, L)$
2. $ua\,q_{i}\, bv$ yields $uac\,q_{j}\,v$ if $\delta(q_{i}, b)=(q_{j}, c, R)$
3. $q_{i}\,bv$ yields $q_j\,cv$ if $b$ is left-most content and TM is moving left
4. $ua\,q_{i}$
