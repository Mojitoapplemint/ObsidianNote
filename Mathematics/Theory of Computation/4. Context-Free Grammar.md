# Grammar
Describe certain features that have a recursive structure, which makes them useful in a variety of application

A grammar consists of a collection of **subsitution rules** (a.k.a production)
- Format: $\text{(variable)}\to\text{(terminals)}$
	- Variable : Capitalized
	- Terminals : Lower case, numbers, special symbols
- One variable is designated as a *start variable*
	- Typically topmost
- A sequence of substitutions to obtain a string is called a derivation
## Describing language
All strings generated by grammar is called *language of the grammar*
- Any language that can be generated by some con

Generate String
1. Write down the start variable. It is the variable on the left-hand side of the top rule, unless specified otherwise. 
2. Find a variable that is written down and a rule that starts with that variable. Replace the written down variable with the right-hand side of that rule. 
3. Repeat step 2 until no variables remain.

**Ex)**
$A\to0A1$
$A\to B$
$B\to\#$

$A\implies 0A 1\implies 00A 11\implies 000A 111\implies 000B 111 \implies 000\# 111$
