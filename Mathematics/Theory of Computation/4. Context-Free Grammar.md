# Grammar
Describe certain features that have a recursive structure, which makes them useful in a variety of application

A grammar consists of a collection of **subsitution rules** (a.k.a production)
- Format: $\text{(variable)}\to\text{(terminals)}$
	- Variable : Capitalized
	- Terminals : Lower case, numbers, special symbols
- One variable is designated as a *start variable*
	- Typically topmost
- A sequence of substitutions to obtain a string is called a derivation
## Describing language
All strings generated by grammar is called *language of the grammar*
- Denoted as $L(G)$ where $G$ is grammar

Generate String
1. Write down the start variable. It is the variable on the left-hand side of the top rule, unless specified otherwise. 
2. Find a variable that is written down and a rule that starts with that variable. Replace the written down variable with the right-hand side of that rule. 
3. Repeat step 2 until no variables remain.

**Ex)**
Let $G$
- $A\to 0A 1\text{ | }B$
	- $A\to0A1$ or $A\to B$
- $B\to\#$

$A\implies 0A 1\implies 00A 11\implies 000A 111\implies 000B 111 \implies 000\# 111$
$\therefore L(G)=\{ 0^{n}\# 1^{n}\text{ | }n\geq 0\}$

# Context-free Grammar (CFG)
A context-free grammar is a 4-tuple $\left( V,\sum,R,S \right)$ where
1. $V$ : Variables (finite)
2. $\sum$ : Terminals; finite, disjoint from $V$
3. $R$ : Finite set of rules
4. $S\in V$ : Start variable

If $u, v$, and $w$ are strings of variables and terminals, and $A â†’ w$ is a rule of the grammar, we say that $uAv$ yields $uwv$, written $uAv \Rightarrow uwv$.
