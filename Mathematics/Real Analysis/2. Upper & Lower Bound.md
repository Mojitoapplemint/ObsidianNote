# Upper Bound
**Notation)**
$$x\leq y \text{ if } x=y \text{ or }x<y$$

If $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, an element $b\in\mathbb{R}$ is said to be an **"Upper Bound"** for $S$ if
$$\forall \text{ }x\in S,\text{ } x\leq b$$
- We say $S$ is bounded above if there is some upper bound for $S$
- Upper Bounds are not unique

Every element in $\mathbb{R}$ is an upper bound for $\emptyset$ 
- There is no element in $\emptyset$, thus hypothesis of the statement is always false, the entire statement is always true

$\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{N}$ has no upper bound

## Least Upper Bound
If $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a **"Least Upper Bound"** for $S$ is an element $\mathscr{l}\in\mathbb{R}$ such that
- $\mathscr{l}$ is upper bound of $S$
	- Notation: $\mathscr{l}=\text{sup}(S)$
- If $b$ is any upper bound of $S$, then $\mathscr{l}\leq b$

Not necessarily in $S$
- $\{x\in\mathbb{R}:0<x<1 \} \implies$ 1 is a least upper bound

$\emptyset$ doesn't have any least upper bound

## Lemma 13. $\leq$ is partial order
Reflexive: $\forall \text{ }x\in\mathbb{R}, x\leq x$
Transitive: $\forall \text{ }a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}, \text{ if }a\leq b\text{ and }b\leq c, \text{ then }a\leq c$
Anti-Symmetric: $\forall \text{ }a,b\in\mathbb{R}, \text{ if }a\leq b\text{ and }b\leq a\text{, then }a=b$

## Lemma 14. $\forall \text{ }x\in\mathbb{R}, x-1<x<x+1$


# Natural Number, $\mathbb{N}$
Define Natural Number $\mathbb{N}$ as the set, $\{1,1+1, 1+1+1\dots\}$

## Lemma 15. Each of numbers in the $\mathbb{N}$ is Distinct, Positive and if $k\in\mathbb{N}$, so is $k+1$


## Lemma 16. Least Upper Bound is Unique
I.e. if $\mathscr{l}_{1}$ and $\mathscr{l}_{2}$ are both least upper bounds for $S$, then $\mathscr{l}_{1}=\mathscr{l}_{2}$
- Since $\mathscr{l}_{1}$ is least upper bound and $\mathscr{l}_{2}$ is still a upper bound, $\mathscr{l}_{1}\leq\mathscr{l}_{2}$
- Since $\mathscr{l}_{2}$ is least upper bound and $\mathscr{l}_{1}$ is still a upper bound, $\mathscr{l}_{2}\leq\mathscr{l}_{1}$
- By Lemma 13, $\mathscr{l}_{1}=\mathscr{l}_{2}$


# Completeness Axioms
The 13 axioms we have so far also apply to the rational numbers, so from this, we could see that these axioms alone can't give us
- "The real number $\sqrt{ 2 }$"
- I.e. A number $x$ so that $x\cdot x=2$

## R.14 $\forall \text{ }S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is non-empty and bounded above, $S$ has a Least Upper Bound
$\implies$ It turns that one can prove there is a unique set which satisfies these 14 axioms

# Results using 14 axioms
## Prop 17. $\mathbb{N}$ is not bounded above $\mathbb{R}$
I.e. there is no $x\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $\forall \text{ }n\in\mathbb{N}, n\leq x$

Proof by Contradiction: Suppose we have some upper bound

By R.14, since $\mathbb{N}$ is non-empty ($1\in\mathbb{N}$), and by assuption, it's bounded, $\mathbb{N}$ has a least upper bound, $\mathscr{l}=\text{sup}(\mathbb{N})$

Consider $\mathscr{l}-1$. Since $\mathscr{l}-1<\mathscr{l}$ and $\mathscr{l}=\text{sup}(\mathbb{N})$, $\mathscr{l}-1$ cannot be upper bound for $\mathbb{N}$
- There is some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ so that $n\nleq \mathscr{l}-1\text{ }(\mathscr{l}-1<n)$

Add 1 to both side $\implies \mathscr{l}<n+1$
- This contradicts since $n+1$ is also natural number, $\mathscr{l}$ is not an upper bound for $\mathbb{N}$

## Prop 18. Archimedean Property of $\mathbb{R}$
For any $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ if $0<a<b$, then there is some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ so that $n\cdot a>b$

Suppose for Contradiction, no such $n$ exists, so by totality $\forall \text{ }n\in\mathbb{N}$, $n\cdot a\leq b$

Since $a>0$, $a^{-1}$ exists and $a^{-1}>0$ by Lemma 12, $(n\cdot a)\cdot a^{-1}=n\leq b\cdot a^{-1}$
- This indicates $\forall \text{ }n\in\mathbb{N}\text{ , }n\leq b\cdot a^{-1}$, which means $b\cdot a^{-1}$ is an upper bound of $\mathbb{N}$. This contradicts prop 17

Therefore, proof by contradiction, there must be $n\in\mathbb{N}$ so that $n\cdot a>b$

## Lemma 19. Suppose that $S$ and $T$ are non-empty bounded-above sets of real numbers such that $S\subseteq T$, then $\text{sup}(S)\leq \text{sup}T$
Let $x$ be an element of $S$. SInce $S\subseteq T, x\in T$ and since $\text{sup}(T)$ is an upper bound for $T$, $x\leq \text{sup}(T)$. THus, $\text{sup}(T)$ is an upper bound for $S$. Thus, since $\text{sup}(S)$ is the least upper bound for $S$, $\text{sup}(S)\leq \text{sup}(T)$

## Lemma 20: For any 2 real numbers, $x$ and $y$, if $x<y$, there is some real number $z$ so that $x<z<y$
Take $z=\frac{x+y}{2}$ (Exercise)

## Lemma 21: If $F\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is non-empty and finite, then $\text{sup}(F)$ exists and equal to the largetst element in $F$
By Totality, each pair of elements $a,b\in F$ has either $a<b$ or $b<a$
- If we compare all the pairs, and we get that $F$ consists of elements
- $a_{1}<a_{2}<a_{3}\dots<a_{n}$

Claim that $\text{sup}(F)=a_{n}$
- It is an upper bound since all other elements are smaller than $a_{n}$
- Any $b\in\mathbb{R}$ is any upper bound for $F$, then $a_{n}\leq b$ since $a_{n}\in F$

So, $a_{n}$ is a least upper bound for $F$

So, for finite set, the $\text{sup}$ always *exists* and *is in the set*

**For Infinite set,** the $\text{sup}$ either
1) May not exist
	- $\mathbb{N}$
2) May exist and be in the set
	- $\text{sup}(x\in\mathbb{R}:0\leq x\leq 1)=1$
3) May exist an not be in the set
	- $\text{sup}(x\in\mathbb{R}:0< x< 1)=1$
	- First, $1$ is an upper bound, since by definition of the set
		- Suppose for contradiction, $b$ is an upper bound and $b\leq 1$, then by Lemma 20, $\exists \text{ }z\in\mathbb{R}$ so that $b<z<1$. This contradicts $b$ being an upper bound 
		- So, any upper bound is $\geq 1$, so 1 is least upper bound
