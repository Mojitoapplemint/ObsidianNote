# Continuous Function(cts)
Continuous at Point
- For function $f(x)$, say that it is continuous at $a$, if $f$ defined at $a$ and $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=f(a)$

Continuous at Set
- Say $f(x)$ is continuou on a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if it is continuous at all pomints of $A$


**Ex)**
$$f(x) = \{^{x\text{ (x}\in\mathbb{Q})}_{o\text{ (x}\not\in\mathbb{Q})}$$
This function is cts at 0, but not at any other point
- $\lim_{ x \to 0 }f(x)=0=f(0)$

## Prop 42. 
$f$ is cts at $a$ iff $f$ is defined at $a$ and $\lim_{ x \to a^{-} } f(x) = \lim_{ x \to a^{+} } f(x)=f(a)$

## Prop 43. Sequence Criterion for Continuity
$f$ is cts at $a$ iff
1) $f$ is defined at $a$
2) For any sequence $\{x_{n}\}$ such that $\lim_{ x \to \infty }x_{n}=a$, $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=f(a)$

# Defining More Function
If $f$ and $g$ are functions and $c\in\mathbb{R}$, define new function as follows
1) $cf$ is defined as $(cf)(x)=c\cdot f(x)$
2) $f+g$ is defined as $(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)$
3) $fg$ is defined as $(fg)(x)=f(x)g(x)$
4) For $x$ such tht $g(x)\neq0$, $\frac{f}{g}$ is defined as $\left( \frac{f}{g} \right)(x) =\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$
5) $f \circ g$ is defined as $(f\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$

# Theorem 44. Arithmetic Theorem for Continuous Function
Suppose $f,g$ are cts at $a$ and $c\in\mathbb{R}$
1) $f(x)=k$ is cts for all $\mathbb{R}$
2) Indentity Function: $f(x)=x$ is cts for all $\mathbb{R}$
3) $cf$ is cts at a
4) $f+g$ is cts at a
5) $fg$ is cts at a
6) If $\frac{f}{g}$ defined for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$, then $\frac{f}{g}$ is cts at $a$

## Prove 4)
We know
- $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=f(a)$
- $\lim_{ x \to a }g(x)=g(a)$

Then, by Limit Arithmetic Theorem, $\lim_{ x \to a }(f(x)+g(x))=f(a)+g(a)$
- So, $f+g$ is cts at $a$

**Note)** Rest can be proved similarly

## Corollary 45
For all polynomial function
$$f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}\dots a_{n}x^{n}=\sum^{n}_{i=1}a_{i}x^{i} $$
is cts for all points

# Prop. Composite Function Continuity
If $f$ is cts at $a$ and $g$ is cts at $f(a)$, then $g\circ f$ is cts at $a$

**Proof)**
Let's use Sequence Criterion

Suppose $\{x_{n}\}$ conv to $a$
- $\lim_{ n \to \infty }x_{n}=a$

Since $f$ is cts at $a$, $\lim_{ n \to \infty }f(x_{n})=f(a)$

Then, since $g$ is cts at $f(a)$, $\lim_{ n \to \infty }g(f(x_{n}))=g(f(a))$

Since $\{x_{n}\}$ was an arbitrary sequence conv to $a$, we get $g\circ f$ is cts at $a$

# Intermediate Value Theorem
cts functions are guaranteed to take retain value

## Lemma 47. Special Case of the Intermediate Value Theorem
Suppose $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, $a<b$, $f$ is a function which is cts on $[a,b]$ and $f(a)<0$ and $f(b)>0$
Then, there exists a $c\in[a,b]$ so that $f(c)=0$

**Proof)**
Define $A=\{x\in(a,b):f(x)<0\}$ and let's find $\text{sup}$ of it
- Non-empty: $f(a)\in A$
- Bounded Above: all $x\in A, x\leq b$

By completeness axiom, $\text{sup}(A)$ exists, let's call it $c$
- $c<b$ is guaranteed that $c$ is $\text{sup}(A)$ and $b$ is an upper bound of $A$
- $a<c$ is guaranteed since $c$ is $\text{sup}(A)$ and $a\in A$

Let's show that $f(c)=0$
- We will show that $f(c)\not<0$ and $f(c)\not>0$, thus by totality, $f(c)=0$

### i) $f(c)\not<0$
Proof by Contradiction) Suppose $f(c)<0$
- We will find a point $d$ "just to the right of $c$" for which $f(d)<0$ also
- Since $c=\text{sup}(A)$, $f(d)<0$ should not happen

Let $\epsilon=\frac{-f(c)}{2}>0$

Since $f$ is cts at $c$, there is some $\delta>0$ so that $\forall \text{ }x$ with $0<|x-c|<\delta$, $f(c)-\epsilon<f(x)<f(c)+\epsilon$
$$f(c)-(\frac{-f(c)}{2})<f(x)<f(c)+\frac{-f(c)}{2}$$
$$\frac{3f(c)}{2}<f(x)<\frac{f(c)}{2}$$
Since $f(c)<0$, $\frac{f(c)}{2}<0$, so for any such $x$, $f(x)<0$

Then, let $d$ be such that $c<d<\min(c+\delta, b)$ and $|d-c|<\delta$
- This $d$ has the property that $d<b$ and $f(d)<0$, thus $d\in A$
- But, we also have $c<d$, but $c=\text{sup}(A)$
- Contradiction as we've found a point in $A$ that is greater than $\text{sup}(A)$

### ii) $f(c)\not>0$
Exercise
- Should get a contradiction with $f(c)$ being the least upper bound


## Theorem 48. Intermediate Value Theorem
Suppose $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, $a<b$, $f$ is cts on $[a,b]$ and $v$ is some point between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$
- Then, there exists a $c\in[a,b]$ so that $f(c)=v$

**Proof)**
Suppose $f(a)<f(b)$ (The case for $f(b)>f(a)$ is similar)

Define a new function $g(x)=f(x)-v$
- Then, $g$ is also cts since both $f(x)$ and $v$ are continuous, thus by Arithmetic Theorem for Continuous Function, $g$ is continuous
- And also $g(a)=f(a)-v<0$ since $f(a)<v$ and $g(b)=f(b)-v>0$ since $f(b)>v$

Then, by Lemma 47, $\exists \text{ }c\in [a,b]$ so that $g(c)=0$
- Therefore, $f(c)=g(c)+v=v$

### Example)
Consider $f(x)=x^{2}$
- cts everywhere by the Arithmetic Theorem
- Also, $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=4$
- By IVT, there exists a  $c\in(1,2)$ so that $f(c)=2$
	- I.e. $c^{2}=2$
	- Now, we proved that $c=\sqrt{ 2 }$ is a real number
		- First example of irational real number

### Example)
Show that $x^{3}-8x+4=0$ has at least one solution
- Find some $a,b$ such that $f(a)<0$ and $f(b)>0$
- Then, by IVT, there is some solution


## Proposition 49
There is a real number $x$ such that $1\leq x\leq 2$ and $x^{2}=2$, and $x$ is irrational. We notate this number as $\sqrt{ 2 }$

Proved by Example 1) above

# There are infinitely many irrational number between any two rational number
## Lemma 50
Suppose $q\in\mathbb{R}$ is irrational, then
1) Then, $q^{-1}$ is also irrational
2) If $r\neq 0$ is rational, then $qr$ is also irrational

Prove 1)
Suppose for contradiction, $q^{-1}$ is rational, so $q^{-1}=\frac{m}{n}$ for some $m,n\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $n\neq 0$
- Then $q=\frac{n}{m}$, which is rational, contradicting the assumpsion

Prove 2) 
Exercise

## Theorem 51. Density of Rationals and Irrationals
Suppose $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, $a<b$. Then there exists a rational number $r$ and irrational number $q$ such that $a<r<b$ and $a<q<b$

Proof by Cases)

i) $a=0$ and $b>0$

Recall [[2. Upper & Lower Bound#Prop 18. Archimedean Property of $ mathbb{R}$|Prop 18.]] 
So for rational number, by Prop 18, $\exists \text{ }n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $nb>1>0$, so then $0<\frac{1}{n}<b$
- $r=\frac{1}{n}$

For irrational number, we know $1\leq \sqrt{ 2}$, so $0<\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}\leq 1$
- Thus, by multiplying this and $0<\frac{1}{n}<b$, $0<\frac{1}{n\sqrt{ 2 }}<b$
- By Lemma 50, $\frac{1}{n\sqrt{ 2 }}$ is irrational, $q=\frac{1}{n\sqrt{ 2 }}$

ii) $0<a<b$
In this case, $0<b-a$, So by case 1, there exists a rational numner $r$ and irrational $q$ such that $0<r<b-a$ and $0<q<b-a$

Then, by Prop 18, there is some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $nr>a$
- Let $k$ be the smallest natural number such that $kr>a$
	- Exercise: Why such $k$ exist?
- Then, since $k$ is the smallest, $(k-1)r\leq a$ 
	- By adding this with $r<b-a$, $kr<b$
- Therefore, $a<kr<b$
	- Since $r$ is rational and $k$ is natural number, $kr$ is still a rational number

Similar proof for $q$, setting $k_{2}\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $a<k_{2}q<b$ is irrational

iii) $a<0\leq b$
Since we've already prove that there is some rational $r$ and irrational $q$ such that $0<r<b$ and $0<q<b$ by case 1, it indeed $a<r<b$ and $a<q<b$ since $a<0$

iv) $a<b<0$
Then, $0<-b<-a$. By case 2, $\exists \text{ }$ rational $r$ and irrational $q$ between $-b$ and $-a$
- $-b<r<-a$ and $-b<q<-a$

Then, $a<-r<b$ and $a<-q<b$
- $r$ is still rational
- $q$ is still irrational by Lemma 50

Therefore, the statement is true by proof by cases

## Corollary 52
For any $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ if $a<b$ then there exist an infinite number of rational and irrational numbers between $a$ and $b$

Proof by Contradiction) Suppose there is only finite number of rationals between $a$ and $b$
- $a<r_{1}<r_{2}<r_{3}\dots r_{n}<b$
- But then by Theorem 51, there is another rational number between $a$ and $r_{1}$, contradicting that the there are only $n$ rationals

Similarly for irrationals

## Cardinality
Cardinality of Rationals is the same with Cardinality of $\mathbb{N}$, but Cardinality of Irrationals is not, the same as Cardinality of $\mathbb{R}$
- Rationals are Countable!

# Extreme Value Theorem
Is about conditions which ensure a function has a largest or smallest value
- In all $\mathbb{R}$
- Or in some closed interval $[a,b]$

Does this always happen?
- If $f$ is cts on $[a,b]$, does it always have a max and min in $[a,b]$?
- Yes!

## Lemma 53
Suppose $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, $a<b$ and  $f$ is cts on $[a,b]$, then $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$
- $\exists \text{ }M,N\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $\forall \text{ }x\in[a,b]$, $N\leq f(x)\leq M$

**Proof)**
Suppose for contradiction, such an $M$ does not exist

So, $M=1$ does not work, so there exists some $x_{1}\in[a,b]$, call it $x_{1}$, so that $f(x_{1})>1$
So, $M=2$ does not work, so there exists some $x_{2}\in[a,b]$, call it $x_{2}$, so that $f(x_{2})>2$
  $\vdots$

i.e. for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there is some $x_{n}\in[a,b]$ so that $f(x_{n})>n$
- So, we have a sequence $\{x_{n}\}$ such that $\forall \text{ }x_{n}\in[a,b], f(x_{n})>n$

Since $\{x_{n}\}$ is bounded, by Bolzano-Weierstraus$$
