# Continuous Function(cts)
Continuous at Point
- For function $f(x)$, say that it is continuous at $a$, if $f$ defined at $a$ and $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=f(a)$

Continuous at Set
- Say $f(x)$ is continuou on a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if it is continuous at all pomints of $A$


**Ex)**
$$f(x) = \{^{x\text{ (x}\in\mathbb{Q})}_{o\text{ (x}\not\in\mathbb{Q})}$$
This function is cts at 0, but not at any other point
- $\lim_{ x \to 0 }f(x)=0=f(0)$

## Prop 42. 
$f$ is cts at $a$ iff $f$ is defined at $a$ and $\lim_{ x \to a^{-} } f(x) = \lim_{ x \to a^{+} } f(x)=f(a)$

## Prop 43. Sequence Criterion for Continuity
$f$ is cts at $a$ iff
1) $f$ is defined at $a$
2) For any sequence $\{x_{n}\}$ such that $\lim_{ x \to \infty }x_{n}=a$, $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=f(a)$

# Defining More Function
If $f$ and $g$ are functions and $c\in\mathbb{R}$, define new function as follows
1) $cf$ is defined as $(cf)(x)=c\cdot f(x)$
2) $f+g$ is defined as $(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)$
3) $fg$ is defined as $(fg)(x)=f(x)g(x)$
4) For $x$ such tht $g(x)\neq0$, $\frac{f}{g}$ is defined as $\left( \frac{f}{g} \right)(x) =\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$
5) $f \circ g$ is defined as $(f\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$

# Theorem 44. Arithmetic Theorem for Continuous Function
Suppose $f,g$ are cts at $a$ and $c\in\mathbb{R}$
1) $f(x)=k$ is cts for all $\mathbb{R}$
2) Indentity Function: $f(x)=x$ is cts for all $\mathbb{R}$
3) $cf$ is cts at a
4) $f+g$ is cts at a
5) $fg$ is cts at a
6) If $\frac{f}{g}$ defined for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$, then $\frac{f}{g}$ is cts at $a$

## Prove 4)
We know
- $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=f(a)$
- $\lim_{ x \to a }g(x)=g(a)$

Then, by Limit Arithmetic Theorem, $\lim_{ x \to a }(f(x)+g(x))=f(a)+g(a)$
- So, $f+g$ is cts at $a$

**Note)** Rest can be proved similarly

## Corollary 45
For all polynomial function
$$f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}\dots a_{n}x^{n}=\sum^{n}_{i=1}a_{i}x^{i} $$
is cts for all points

# Prop. Composite Function Continuity
If $f$ is cts at $a$ and $g$ is cts at $f(a)$, then $g\circ f$ is cts at $a$

**Proof)**
Let's use Sequence Criterion

Suppose $\{x_{n}\}$ conv to $a$
- $\lim_{ n \to \infty }x_{n}=a$

Since $f$ is cts at $a$, $\lim_{ n \to \infty }f(x_{n})=f(a)$

Then, since $g$ is cts at $f(a)$, $\lim_{ n \to \infty }g(f(x_{n}))=g(f(a))$

Since $\{x_{n}\}$ was an arbitrary sequence conv to $a$, we get $g\circ f$ is cts at $a$

# Intermediate Value Theorem
cts functions are guaranteed to take retain value

## Lemma 47. Special Case of the Intermediate Value Theorem
Suppose $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, $a<b$, $f$ is a function which is cts on $[a,b]$ and $f(a)<0$ and $f(b)>0$
Then, there exists a $c\in[a,b]$ so that $f(c)=0$

**Proof)**
Define $A=\{x\in(a,b):f(x)<0\}$ and let's find $\text{sup}$ of it
- Non-empty: $f(a)\in A$
- Bounded Above: all $x\in A, x\leq b$

By completeness axiom, $\text{sup}(A)$ exists, let's call it $c$
- $c<b$ is guaranteed that $c$ is $\text{sup}(A)$ and $b$ is an upper bound of $A$
- $a<c$ is guaranteed since $c$ is $\text{sup}(A)$ and $a\in A$

Let's show that $f(c)=0$
- We will show that $f(c)\not<0$ and $f(c)\not>0$, thus by totality, $f(c)=0$

i) $f(c)\not<0$
Proof by Contradiction) Suppose $f(c)<0$
- We will find a point $d$ "just to the right of $c$" for which $f(d)<0$ also
- Since $c=\text{sup}(A)$, $f(d)<0$ should not happen

Let $\epsilon=\frac{-f(c)}{2}>0$

Since $f$ is cts at $c$, there is some $\delta>0$ so that $\forall \text{ }x$ with $0<|x-c|<\delta$, $f(c)-\epsilon<f(x)<f(c)+\epsilon$
$$f(c)-(\frac{-f(c)}{2})<f(x)<f(c)+\frac{-f(c)}{2}$$
$$\frac{3f(c)}{2}<f(x)<\frac{f(c)}{2}$$
Since $f(c)<0$, $\frac{f(c)}{2}<0$, so for any such $x$, $f(x)<0$

Then, let $d$ be such that $c<d<\min(c+\delta, b)$ and $|d-c|<\delta$
