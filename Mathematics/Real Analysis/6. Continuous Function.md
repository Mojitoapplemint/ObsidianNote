# Continuous Function(cts)
Continuous at Point
- For function $f(x)$, say that it is continuous at $a$, if $f$ defined at $a$ and $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=f(a)$

Continuous at Set
- Say $f(x)$ is continuou on a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if it is continuous at all pomints of $A$


**Ex)**
$$f(x) = \{^{x\text{ (x}\in\mathbb{Q})}_{o\text{ (x}\not\in\mathbb{Q})}$$
This function is cts at 0, but not at any other point
- $\lim_{ x \to 0 }f(x)=0=f(0)$

## Prop 42. 
$f$ is cts at $a$ iff $f$ is defined at $a$ and $\lim_{ x \to a^{-} } f(x) = \lim_{ x \to a^{+} } f(x)=f(a)$

## Prop 43. Sequence Criterion for Continuity
$f$ is cts at $a$ iff
1) $f$ is defined at $a$
2) For any sequence $\{x_{n}\}$ such that $\lim_{ x \to \infty }x_{n}=a$, $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=f(a)$

# Defining More Function
If $f$ and $g$ are functions and $c\in\mathbb{R}$, define new function as follows
1) $cf$ is defined as $(cf)(x)=c\cdot f(x)$
2) $f+g$ is defined as $(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)$
3) $fg$ is defined as $(fg)(x)=f(x)g(x)$
4) For $x$ such tht $g(x)\neq0$, $\frac{f}{g}$ is defined as $\left( \frac{f}{g} \right)(x) =\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$
5) $f \circ g$ is defined as $(f\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$

# Theorem 44. Arithmetic Theorem for Continuous Function
Suppose $f,g$ are cts at $a$ and $c\in\mathbb{R}$
1) $f(x)=k$ is cts for all $\mathbb{R}$
2) Indentity Function: $f(x)=x$ is cts for all $\mathbb{R}$
3) $cf$ is cts at a
4) $f+g$ is cts at a
5) $fg$ is cts at a
6) If $\frac{f}{g}$ defined for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$, then $\frac{f}{g}$ is cts at $a$

## Prove 4)
We know
- $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=f(a)$
- $\lim_{ x \to a }g(x)=g(a)$

Then, by Limit Arithmetic Theorem, $\lim_{ x \to a }(f(x)+g(x))=f(a)+g(a)$
- So, $f+g$ is cts at $a$

**Note)** Rest can be proved similarly

## Corollary 45
For all polynomial function
$$f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}\dots a_{n}x^{n}=\sum^{n}_{i=1}a_{i}x^{i} $$
is cts for all points

# Prop. Composite Function Continuity
If $f$ is cts at $a$ and $g$ is cts at $f(a)$, then $g\circ f$ is cts at $a$

**Proof)**
Let's use Sequence Criterion

Suppose $\{x_{n}\}$ conv to $a$
- $\lim_{ n \to \infty }x_{n}=a$

Since $f$ is cts at $a$, $\lim_{ n \to \infty }f(x_{n})=f(a)$

Then, since $g$ is cts at $f(a)$, $\lim_{ n \to \infty }g(f(x_{n}))=g(f(a))$

Since $\{x_{n}\}$ was an arbitrary sequence conv to $a$, we get $g\circ f$ is cts at $a$
