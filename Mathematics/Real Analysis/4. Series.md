With Series, we want to make precise the notion of an "Infinite Sum"
- $\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{n}$
- $0.9999\dots$

We want to think about these "Partial Sums" and what ehy converges to

# Partial Sums
Given any sequence $\{a_{n}\}$, its sequence of partial sums, written $\{A_{n}\}$ is the sequence defined by
$A_{1}=a_{1}$
$A_{2}=a_{1}+a_{2}$
$A_{3}=a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}$
 $\vdots$

**Q )**
For any $\{a_{n}\}$ is $\{A_{n}\}$ always increasing?
- No, Only if each $a_{n}\geq 0$

# 
Given any sequence $\{a_{n}\}$ we say t
