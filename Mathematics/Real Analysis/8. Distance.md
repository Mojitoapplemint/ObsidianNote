How can we generalize this idea?
- In multivariable Function, etc

One of the core ideas in a lot of our definition is the idea of **distance**
- $0<|x-a|<\delta$ means that distance between $x$ and $a$ is between $0$ and $\delta$

What is the most natural way to measure the distance between $n$ points?
- Euclidean Distance

What if we can move only horizontally and vertically?
- Then the distance would be : $|\text{ Horizontal Distance }|+|\text{ Vertical Distance }|$

# Metric Space
Some set $X$ to gether with a function $d:X\times X\to\mathbb{R}$ which should satisfy some basic rules
1. Non-negative: $\forall \text{ }x,y\in X$, $d(x,y)\geq{0}$
2. $\forall \text{ }x\in X$, $d(x,x)=0$
3. Symmetric: $\forall \text{ }x,y\in X$, $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$
4. Triangular Inequality: $\forall \text{ }x,y,z\in X$, $d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)$
5. $\forall \text{ }x,y\in X$ of $x\neq y$, then $d(x,y)\neq 0$

**Note)** We can think $d$ as some notion of distance
