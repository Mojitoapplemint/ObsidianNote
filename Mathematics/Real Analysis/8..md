How can we generalize this idea?
- In multivariable Function, etc

One of the core ideas in a lot of our definition is the idea of **distance**
- $0<|x-a|<\delta$ means that distance between $x$ and $a$ is between $0$ and $\delta$

What is the most natural way to measure the distance between $n$ points?
- Euclidean Distance

What if we can move only horizontally and vertically?
- Then the distance would be : $|\text{ Horizontal Distance }|+|\text{ Vertical Distance }|$
