# Binary Operations
Binary Operation on a set $A$
- A function: $A\times A \rightarrow A$
- Takes two elements from $A$ as inputs and we can get something from $A$ as output

# Further Rules can be proved
## 1. For any $x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}$, if $x+y=x+z$, then $y=z$
Assume $x+y=x+z$

By $R.4$, there is a $-x\in\mathbb{R}$. Add it to both sides
- $-x+(x+y)=-x+(x+z)$
Then, by Associativity of Addition ($R.1$), 
- $(-x+x)+y=(-x+x)+z$
By Communitativity of addition ($R.2$)
- $(x+(-x))+y=(x+(-x))+z$
By Inverse of Addition ($R.4$)
- $0+y=0+z$
By Communitativity of addition ($R.2$)
- $y+0=z+0$
By Unitiality of Addition ($R.3$)
- $y=z$
