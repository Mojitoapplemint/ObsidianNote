One of the core ideas in a lot of our definition is the idea of **distance**
- $0<|x-a|<\delta$ means that distance between $x$ and $a$ is between $0$ and $\delta$

# Metric Space
A Metric Space consists of a set $X$ with a distance function $d:X\times X\to\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies following 5 axioms:
1. $\forall \text{ }x,y\in X$, $d(x,y)\geq{0}$
2. $\forall \text{ }x\in X$, $d(x,x)=0$
3. $\forall \text{ }x,y\in X$ if $x\neq y$, then $d(x,y)\neq 0$
	- Equivalently: If $d(x,y)=0$, then $x=y$
4. $\forall \text{ }x,y\in X$, $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$
	- Symmetry
5. $\forall \text{ }x,y,z\in X$, $d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)$
	- Triangular Inequality

**Note)** We can think $d$ as some notion of distance. $d$ is called Metric

## Examples & Exercises
**Ex)**
Let $X=\mathbb{R}$, with distance function $\mathscr{l}(x,y)=|x-y|$
- Does this satisfy those 5 axioms?

1. Since absolute value is always nonnegative, $\forall \text{ }x,y\in X, d(x,y)\geq0$
2. $\forall \text{ }x\in X, d(x,x)=|x-x|=0$
3. If $d(x,y)=0$, then $|x-y|=0$. So, $x-y=0$, thus $x=y$
4. $\forall \text{ }x,y\in X$, $d(x,y)=|x-y| = |-1||y-x|=|y-x|=d(y,x)$
5. $\forall \text{ }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}$, $d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)\implies |x-z|\leq|x-y|+|y-z|$
	- $d(x,z)=|x-z| = |x-y+y-z|\leq|x-y|+|y-z|$ by absolute value property
	- $=d(x,y)+d(y,z)$

So, indeed set $X=\mathbb{R}$ with distance function $d(x,y)=|x-y|$ is a Metric Space

**Ex)**
For **any** set $X$, if we define $d:X\times X\to\mathbb{R}$ by
$$d(x,y)=\Big\{^{1 \text{ if }x\neq y}_{{0\text{ if }x=y}}$$
Then $(X,d)$ will be a metric space. $d$ is specifically called the *discrete metric*

**Ex)**
For the set $X=\mathbb{R}^{n}\text{ }(n\in\mathbb{N})$
We can get a metric space where
$$d(x,y)=\sqrt{ \sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_{i}-y_{i})^{2}  }$$
-  Called Euclidean Distance/Metric

Also
$$d(x,y)=\sqrt{ \sum^{n}_{i=1}|x_{i}-y_{i}|  }$$
- Called Taxicab Metric
- **Exercise)** Check these are metric space for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$

**Ex)**
For any $n\in\mathbb{N}$, a different metric is 
$$d(x,y)=\max(|x_{i}-y_{i}|: 1\leq i\leq n)$$
- Called Max Metric
- **Exercise)** Prove that this is a Metric Space

Can we instead use $d(x,y)=\min(|x_{i}-y_{i}|: 1\leq i\leq n)$?
- No, $x=(1,7,4)$ and $y=(2,10,4)$, then $x\neq y$, but $d(x,y)=0$
	- If $n>1$ only, because if $n=1$, then it is usual metric $d(x,y)=|x-y|$

**Ex)**
If we fix 2 real numbers $a<b$, and let $X=\{ f:(a,b)\to\mathbb{R}\text{ | } f\text{ is cts on all of }[a,b] \}$
and define $d(f,g)=\text{sup}\Big(\{|f(x)-g(x)|:x\in[a,b]\}\Big)$
- Why does this $\text{sup}$ exists?
	- By EVT or by definition of $\text{sup}$ and completeness axiom
- Then $(X,d)$ is indeed Metric Space

Another possible Metric is $d(f,g)=\displaystyle\int^{a}_{b} |f(x)-g(x)| d{x}$
- Total area between $f$ and $g$ in $[a,b]$

**Exercise)**
$X=\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with $d((x_{1},x_{2}),(y_{1},y_{2}))=\sqrt{ (x_{1}-y_{1})^{2}+(x_{2}-y_{2})^{2} }$
- Is Metric Space

**Exercise)**
$X=\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with $d((x_{1},x_{2}),(y_{1},y_{2}))=|x_{1}-y_{1}|-|x_{2}-y_{2}|$
- Is Metric Space

# Sequence Convergence in a Metric Space
For any set $X$, a sequence in $X$ is a function $a:\mathbb{N}\to X$

Suppose $(X,d)$ is a metric space, $\{ a_{n} \}$ is a sequence in $X$, and $L\in X$. We say that $\{ a_{n} \}$ conv to $L$ in $(X,d)$ if 
- $\forall \text{ }\epsilon>0$, $\exists \text{ }K\in\mathbb{R}$ so that $\forall \text{ }n>K$, $d(a_{n}, L)<\epsilon$
- Then, we write $\lim_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=L$

## Example)
Let $X=\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $d=\max(|x_{1}-y_{1}|, |x_{2}-y_{2}|)$ and $a_{n}=\left( \frac{1}{n}, 3-\frac{2}{n} \right)$

Claim: In $(X,d)$, $\{ a_{n} \}$ is conv to $(0,3)$

**Rough Work)**
$d\left( \left( \frac{1}{n}, 3-\frac{2}{n} \right), (0,3) \right)=\max\left( |\frac{1}{n}-0|, |3-\frac{2}{n}-3| \right)=\max\left( \frac{1}{n}, \frac{2}{n} \right)=\frac{2}{n}$
- We want $\frac{2}{n}<\epsilon$, so let's take $K=\frac{2}{\epsilon}$

**Proof)**
Let $\epsilon>0$, let $K=\frac{2}{\epsilon}$
Suppose $n>K$
Consider $d(a_{n},L)$
$= d\left( \left( \frac{1}{n}, 3-\frac{2}{n} \right), (0,3) \right)=\max\left( |\frac{1}{n}-0|, |3-\frac{2}{n}-3| \right)=\max\left( \frac{1}{n}, \frac{2}{n} \right)=\frac{2}{n}$
- Then, $<\frac{2}{K}$ since $n>K$
- $=\frac{2}{\frac{2}{\epsilon}}=\epsilon$

So, indeed in this metric, $\{ a_{n} \}$ conv to $(0,3)$

## Example)
Let $X=\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $d(x,y)=\Big\{^{1 \text{ if }x\neq y}_{{0\text{ if }x=y}}$ and $a_{n}=\left( \frac{1}{n}, 3-\frac{2}{n} \right)$
- In this metric space, does $\{ a_{n} \}$ conv to $(0,3)$
- No, $\forall \text{ }n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\left( \frac{1}{n}, 3-\frac{2}{n} \right)$ never equal to $(0,3)$
	- So, for this $d$, $d(a_{n},L)=1$ for all $n$
- It will be impossible to satisfy the definition for any $\epsilon<1$

# Prop 67 Sequence convergence is unique in metric space
Suppose $(X,d)$ is a metric space, $\{ a_{n} \}$ is a sequence in $X$, and $\{ a_{n} \}$ converges to $L$ and to $M$ in $(X,d)$, then $L=M$

**Proof)**
Suppose for contradiction, $L\neq M$
Let $\epsilon=\frac{d(L,M)}{2}>0$
- Since $L\neq M$, $d(L,M)>0$ by axioms 1 and 3

Since $\{ a_{n} \}$ conv to $L$, there is some $K_{1}\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $\forall \text{ }n>K_{1}$, $d(a_{n, L})<\epsilon$

Since $\{ a_{n} \}$ to $M$, there is some $K_{2}\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $\forall \text{ }n>K_{2}$, $d(a_{n, M})<\epsilon$

Then, for any $n>\max(K_{1}, K_{2})$, $d(a_{n},L)<\epsilon$ and $d(a_{n}, M)<\epsilon$

Consider $d(L,M)$
$$\leq d(L,a_{n})+d(a_{n}, M)$$
- By trianular inequality, 
$$=d(a_{n},L)+d(a_{n}, M)$$
by Symmetry(Axiom 4) of Metric Space
$$<2\epsilon = 2\cdot\frac{d(L,M)}{2}=d(L,M)$$
$$\therefore d(L,M)<d(L,M)$$
which is a contradiction.

Therefore, $L=M$ by proof by contradiction

# Cachy Sequence
Suppose $(X,d)$ is a metric space, $\{ a_{n} \}$ is a sequence in $X$. Say that $\{ a_{n} \}$ is Cauchy Sequnce in $(X,d)$ if $\forall \text{ }\epsilon>0$, $\exists \text{ }K\in\mathbb{R}$ so that $\forall \text{ }n,m>K$, $d(a_{n}, a_{m})<\epsilon$

**Recall** that for real number and $|x-y|$, $\{ a_{n} \}$ is Cauchy iff $\{ a_{n} \}$ conv to some $L\in\mathbb{R}$
- Is this true in any Metric Space?
- i.e. 
	- If $\{ a_{n} \}$ converges to some $L$ in $(X,d)$, then $\{ a_{n} \}$ is Cauchy
		- This is True
	- If $\{ a_{n} \}$ is Cauchy, then $\{ a_{n} \}$ converges to some $L$ in $(X,d)$
		- This is False

## Prop 68
If $(X,d)$, is a metric space and $\{ a_{n} \}$ is a sequence in $X$ which converges to $L$ in $(X,d)$ then $\{ a_{n} \}$ is Cauchy

**Proof)**
Let $\epsilon>0$
Since $\{ a_{n} \}$ conv to $L$, there is some $K\in\mathbb{R}$ so that $\forall \text{ }n>K$, $d(a_{n}, L)<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$

Suppose $m,n>K$, and consider $d(a_{n}, a_{m})$
$$<d(a_{n}, L)+d(a_{m},L)$$
By Axiom 4 and 5
$$=\frac{\epsilon}{2}+\frac{\epsilon}{2}=\epsilon$$
since $m,n>K$

Therefore, $\{ a_{n} \}$ is Cauchy

### Its Converse is not always true
If $\{ a_{n} \}$ is Cauchy, then $\{ a_{n} \}$ converges to some $L$ in $(X,d)$

Let $X=(0,2)$ and define $d:X\times X\to\mathbb{R}$ by $d(a,b)=|a-b|$
- And let $\{ a_{n} \}=\frac{1}{n}$

Then, $\{ a_{n} \}$ is Cauchy since it was Cauchy in the usual metric space. But this does not converge to any $L\in(0,2)$. If it did, that would mean $\left\{  \frac{1}{n}  \right\}$ would converge to 2 different points in $\mathbb{R}$

# Cauchy-Complete
Say that a metric space $(X,d)$ is Cauchy-Complete if for all $\{ a_{n} \}$ is a cauchy sequence in $(X,d)$, then $\{ a_{n} \}$ converges to some $L$ in  $(X,d)$

**Ex)**
$(\mathbb{R}, d(a,b)=|a-b|)$ is Cauchy-Complete, by result, from earlier in the course, using completeness axiom

$((0,2), d(a,b)=|a-b|)$ is not Cauchy-Complete

$([0,2), d(a,b)=|a-b|)$ is not Cauchy-Complete
- $\left\{  2-\frac{1}{n}  \right\}$ is cauchy, but not convergent

$([0,2], d(a,b)=|a-b|)$ is 
- Note: We've proven result which show that if there are $B_{1}, B_{2}$ so that $\forall \text{ }n, B_{1}\leq a_{n}\leq B_{2}$, then if $\lim_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=L$, also $B_{1}\leq L\leq B_{2}$
- If $\{ a_{n} \}$ was cauchy in this metric space, then it would converge to something in $(\mathbb{R}, d(a,b)=|a-b|)$, and what it converges to would also be in $(0,2)$ by the statement above

For any set $X$, discrete Metric is Cauchy-Complete

The metrics we've presiously mentioned on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$(Euclidean distance, Taxicab distance, Max distance) are all Cauchy-Complete

# Expanding to the larger set
An arbitrary metric space $(X,d)$ need not be Cauchy-Complete does it lie in a larger metric space?
- Given metric space $(X,d)$, can we find another metric space $(X',d')$ and a function $f:X\to X'$ so that
	- $(X', d')$ is Cauchy-Complete
	- $f$ is 1-to-1
	- $\forall \text{ }x,y\in X$, $d(x,y)=d'(f(x),f(y))$

$((0,1), d(a,b)=|a-b|)$ has such a larger space: $X'=[0,1]$ and $d(a,b)=|a-b|$, and $f:(0,1)\to[0,1], f(x)=x$ 
- Or even $X'=\mathbb{R}$

For any $(X,d)$, does such an $(X', d')$ always exist?
- Yes
- Let $X'=\text{Set of Cauchy Sequence in }X$ (i)
	- Ex) $X=(0,1)$ and $d(a,b)=|a-b|$, then $\left\{  \frac{1}{n}  \right\}$ would be element of $X'$
- Then, define $d'(\{ a_{n} \}, \{ b_{n} \})=\lim_{ n \to \infty }d(a_{n}, b_{n})$ 
	- Needs to show this limit actually exists
	- Ex) $a_{n}=\left\{  \frac{1}{n}  \right\}$ and $\{ b_{n} \}=\left\{  \frac{1}{2}  \right\}$
	- $d'(a_{n}, b_{n})=\frac{1}{2}$
- Define $f:X\to X'$
	- $f(x)=$ The sequence which is constant $x$
	- Unfortunately, this doesn't quite work, as you can have $d(\{ a_{n} \}, \{ b_{n} \})=0$, but $\{ a_{n} \}\neq \{ b_{n} \}$
- We need to make a small modification: 
	- Say 2 elements of $X'$ are equivalent, and write $\{ a_{n} \}\sim\{ b_{n} \}$ if $\lim_{ n \to \infty }d(a_{n}, b_{n})=0$
	- Then, take $X''=X'/\sim =$ set of equivalence classes of this equiv relation
	- $(X'', d')$ is a metric space, can define $f:X\to X''$, $f(x)=$ equivalence class of the constant sequence $\{ x \}$  
	- Can show this satisfies all the required properties

# Open and Closed Interval in Metric Space
If $(X,d)$ is a metric space, can we consider $a\in X$ $x_{1}<a<x_{2}$ for some $x_{1},x_{2}\in X$?
- This doesn't make sense in general because $X$ could be anything, we don't have necessarily have an "order" for the element of $X$
- Instead, we can look at "open balls" in a metric space, and then further generalize to open sets

## Open Ball
Suppose $(X,d)$ is a metirc space, $a\in X$, and $r\in\mathbb{R}$ with $r>0$
Define the open ball of radius $r$ around $a$ in $(X,d)$ to be the set 
$$B_{r}(a)=\{ x\in X:d(a,x)<r \}$$

**Ex)**
In $(\mathbb{R}, \text{usual metric})$, $B_{1}((0,0))=(-1,1)$

In $(\mathbb{R}^{2}, \text{Euclidean Distance})$ $B_{1}((0,0))=\{ (x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}:\sqrt{ x^{2}+y^{2} }<1 \}$

In $(\mathbb{R}^{2}, \text{Taxicab})$, $B_{1}((0,0))=$

In $(\mathbb{R}^{2}, \text{Max Metric})$, $B_{1}((0,0))=$

In $(\mathbb{R}^{2}, \text{Discrete})$, $B_{1}((0,0)) = \{ (0,0) \}$

In $(\mathbb{R}^{2}, \text{Discrete})$, $B_{2}((0,0))=\{ (x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^{2} \}$

## Open Subset
If $(X,d)$ is a Metric Space, and $A\subseteq X$ is said to be an open subset of $(X,d)$ if for any $a\in A$, there exists an $\epsilon>0$ so that $B_{\epsilon}(a)\subseteq A$

**Ex)**
In $(\mathbb{R}, \text{Usual Metric})$, the set $[0,1]$ is not open
- If we take $a=0$, this will be a problem
- For any $\epsilon>0$, $B_{\epsilon}(0)$ will contain negative values so we cannot have $B_{\epsilon}(0)<[0,1]$

In $(\mathbb{R}, \text{Usual Metric})$, the set $(0,1)$ is open
- Let $a\in(0,1)$, and take $\epsilon=$"Distance to the nearest point"
- This should have $B_{\epsilon}(0)\subseteq(0,1)$

In $(\mathbb{R}, \text{Usual Metric})$, the set $(0,1)\cup(2,3)$ is not open
- This is an open set which is not open ball

$\emptyset$ is an open set of any $(X,d)$
- Since there is no element to check

Is $\mathbb{R}$ an open subset of $(\mathbb{R}, \text{usual metric})$?
- Yes, and more generally again this is true for any $(X,d)$ since for any $a$ and $\epsilon>0$, $B_{\epsilon}(a)=\{ x\in X:d(x,a)<\epsilon \}\subseteq\mathbb{R}$
- For any $(X,d)$, $X$ is an open subset of $(X,d)$

In $([0,1], d(x,y)=|x-y|)$, $[0,1]$ is open in this open metric space 
- But not open in $(\mathbb{R}, \text{usual metric})$

In $(\mathbb{R}, \text{discrete metric})$, is $[0,1]$ an open subset?
- Yes, for any $a\in[0,1]$, we can take $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}$, then $B_{\epsilon}(a)=\left\{  x\in[0,1]:d\left( x,y \right)<\frac{1}{2}  \right\}=\{ a \}$ since $d(x,a)$ must be 0 to be in the ball, thus it is a subset of $[0,1]$
- More generally, for any set $X$, and $a$ the discrete metric, any subset $A\subseteq X$ is open in $(X,d)$

## Prop 69
If $(X,d)$ is metric space, for any $a\in X$ and $r>0$, $B_{r}(a)$ is an open subset of $(X,d)$

**Proof)**
Let $x\in X$, we need to find an $\epsilon>0$ so that $B_{\epsilon}(a)\subseteq B_{r}(a)$

Let $\epsilon=r-d(x,a)$
- Note since $x\in B_{r}(a)$, $d(a,x)<r$, so $\epsilon>0$
- Now, we want to show $B_{\epsilon}(x)\subseteq B_{r}(a)$

Let $y\in B_{\epsilon}(x)$, let's show $y\in B_{r}(a)$
$d(a,y)\leq d(a,x)+d(x,y)<d(a,x)+\epsilon = d(a,x)+r-d(x,a)=r$
	$\therefore d(a,y)<r$

Since $x$ was arbitrary, $B_{r}(a)$ is indeed open
# Close Subset
Want to generalize sets like $[0,1]$
- One property this set has is if $\{ a_{n} \}$ is a sequence entirely in $[0,1]$, and it converges to $L$, then $L\in[0,1]$
- This is not true for, for example, $((0,1), a_{n}=\frac{1}{n})$ is always in the set but what it converges is not

## Close Subset
Suppose $(X,d)$ is a metric space, $A\subseteq X$, $A$ is said to be closed in $(X,d)$ if for any sequence $\{ a_{n} \}$ such that $\forall \text{ }n\in\mathbb{N}$, $a_{n}\in A$, and $\{ a_{n} \}$ converges to $L$, then $L\in A$ also

**Ex)**
$[0,1]$ is closed in $(\mathbb{R}, \text{usual metric})$

$\emptyset$ is closed in any metric space

In an arbitrary metric space $(X,d)$, is $X$ closed?
- Yes, $\{ a_{n} \}$ converges to $L$ in $(X,d)$, the  $L$ by definition must be in $X$
- So, $X$ is closed

For any set $X$, if $d$ is the discrete metric for any $A\subseteq X$, $A$ is closed in $(X,d)$
- Suppose $\{ a_{n} \}$ is a sequence in $A$ converges to $L$ in $X$, by ass question, $\{ a_{n} \}$ must be eventually constant, and so converges to one of the values in the sequence, which are all by definition in $A$, so $L$ is in $A$, so $A$ is closed

**Exercise)**
Show any finite non-empty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed but not open $(\mathbb{R}, \text{usual metric})$

## Prop 70
If $(X,d)$ is a metric space, $A\subseteq X$, then $A$ is closed in $(X,d)$ iff $X\text{ \\ }A=\{ x\in X:x\not\in A \}$ is open in $(X,d)$

**Proof)**
i) Forward Direction: by contrapositive
- If $X\text{\\}A$ is not open, then $A$ is not closed
- Then there is some point $x\in X\text{\\}A$ such that for all $\epsilon>0$, $B_{\epsilon}(x)\not\subseteq X\text{\\}A$

If we let $\epsilon=1$, there is some $a_{1}\in A$ such that $a_{1}\in B_{1}(x)$
If we let $\epsilon=2$, there is some $a_{2}\in A$ such that $a_{2}\in B_{1}(x)$
	$\vdots$
Generally, for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, there is an $a_{n}\in A$ with $a_{n}\in B_{\frac{1}{n}}(x)$

Then, claim that $\{ a_{n} \}$ conv to $x$. Given any $\epsilon>0$, let $K=\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, sps $n>K$. then $\frac{1}{n}<\epsilon$
- Then, $d(a_{n}, x)<\frac{1}{n}$ since $x\in B_{\frac{1}{n}}(x)$
- $\therefore d(a_{n}, x)<\epsilon$
- So $\{ a_{n} \}$ is all in $A$, yet converges to $x\not\in A$. So, $A$ is not closed
