In this course, function we talk about with be ones whose domain is $\mathbb{R}$ (or some subset of $\mathbb{R}$), and whose codomain is $\mathbb{R}$

# Precise Definition of $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)$
$\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)$ may...
1) Not exist
2) Exists, but not equal to $f(a)$
3) Is $f(a)$
	- Later we will define $f$ to be continuous if this happens for all $a$

## Definition of $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=L$
Suppose $f(x)$ is a function
- Whose domain is some subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and codomain $\mathbb{R}$
and $a,L\in\mathbb{R}$, then we say that "the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches a equals to $L$", and write $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=L$ if
1) 




Intuitively, it's "As $x$ gets close to $a$, $f(x)$ gets close to $L$"
