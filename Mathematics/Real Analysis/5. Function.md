In this course, function we talk about with be ones whose domain is $\mathbb{R}$ (or some subset of $\mathbb{R}$), and whose codomain is $\mathbb{R}$

# Precise Definition of $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)$
$\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)$ may...
1) Not exist
2) Exists, but not equal to $f(a)$
3) Is $f(a)$
	- Later we will define $f$ to be continuous if this happens for all $a$

# Epsilon-Delta Definition of limit
![[Pasted image 20241011115203.png|250]]
Suppose $f(x)$ is a function
- Whose domain is some subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and codomain $\mathbb{R}$
and $a,L\in\mathbb{R}$, then we say that "the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches a equals to $L$", and write $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=L$ if for all $\epsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ so that for all $x$ such that 
- If $0<|x-a|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$

"No matter how close you want $f(x)$ to set to $L$, you can do this so long as $x$ is sufficiently close to $a$, but except at $x=a$"

**Note)** as with the definition of sequence convergence, the $\delta$ wil vary depending on $\epsilon$

## Example) $\lim_{ x \to 5 }(4x-3)=17$
Rough Work) 
Given any $\epsilon>0$, we need to set $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$ and we can make $|x-a|$ small

$$|4x-3-17|=|4x-20|=|4| |x-5|<\epsilon$$
$$\implies|x-5|<\frac{\epsilon}{4}$$
Let $\epsilon>0$ and set $\delta=\frac{\epsilon}{4}$
- Let $x$ be such that $0<|x-5|<\delta$

Then consider $|f(x)-17|$
$$=|4x-3-17|=|4x-20|=4 |x-5|<4\delta=4\cdot\left( \frac{\epsilon}{4} \right)=\epsilon$$

So since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, we have shown that $\lim_{ x \to 5 }(4x-3)=17$

**Note)**
- **Let** is indicating that some value is arbitrary and **set** is fixing some value
