A sequence (of real numbers) is some list of real numbers, one for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ 
- Don't have to be given by some formula, can be random
	- **Ex)** The terms could be given by calling a die
- Must be infinitely long

More precisely:
 A Sequence (of real numbers) is a function $a:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
 - Rather than $a(1), a(2)\dots$, we use $a_{1}, a_{2}\dots$ for each term of the sequence
 - Often write the entire sequence as $\{a_{n}\}$
	 - $\{a_{n}\}^{\infty}_{n=1}$
	 - $\{a_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$

Can be specified using
1) A pattern (e.g. $2,4,6,8\dots$)
2) A Formula, (e.g. $a_{n}=(-1)^{n}$)
3) A Recursive Formula, ($a_{1}=1, a_{2}=2, \text{ For }n>2, a_{n}=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$)
4) Or by a case
	- $a_{n}=5 \text{ if }n<10$
	- $a_{n}=10 \text{ if }10\leq n<20$
	- $a_{n}=6.8 \text{ if }n\geq 20$

# Convergence
Some sequence "Set close to a specified value" 
- i.e. Converge to Something
- $\left\{ \frac{1}{n} \right\}$ converges to 0
- $\{(-1)^{n}\}$ does not converge to something
- $\left\{ \frac{(-1)^{n}}{n} \right\}$ converges to 0
	- Note that this does not converge to eith
