A sequence (of real numbers) is some list of real numbers, one for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ 
- Don't have to be given by some formula, can be random
	- **Ex)** The terms could be given by calling a die
- Must be infinitely long

More precisely:
 A Sequence (of real numbers) is a function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$
 - Rather than $a(1), a(2)\dots$, we use $a_{1}, a_{2}\dots$ for each term
