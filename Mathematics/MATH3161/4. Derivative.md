# Derivative
Given $f: u \to \mathbb{C}, u\in\mathbb{C}$, the complex derivative of $f$ at $z\in \mathbb{C}$ is 
$$\frac{d}{dz}f(z_{0}) =f'(z_{0}) = \lim_{ z \to z_{0} } \frac{{f(z)-f(z_{0})}}{{z-z_{o}}}$$
if this exist, $f$ is called (complex) differentiable at $z_{0}$

If $f$ is differentiable in every point in an **open set** $u$, we say $f$ is **holomorphic** on $u$
- Being holomorphic at $z_{0}$ means that function $f()$ is complex differentiable in some open set $u$ contains $z_{0}$

## Example
Find the derivative of $f(z) = z^2$
$$f'(z_{0}) = \lim_{ z \to z_{0} } \frac{{f(z)-f(z_{0})}}{{z-z_{o}}}$$
$$f'(z_{0}) = \lim_{ z \to z_{0} } \frac{z^2-z_{0}^2}{z-z_{o}}$$
$$f'(z_{0}) = \lim_{ z \to z_{0} } \frac{(z-z_{0})(z+z_{0})}{z-z_{o}}$$
$$\lim_{ z \to z_{0} } z+z_{0} = 2z_{0}$$

Thus, $f$ is differentiable at any $z_{0}\in \mathbb{C}$, with derivative of $2z_{0}$

## Same with Cal 1!
Similarly 
- if $f(z)=z$, $f'(z) = 1$ everywhere
- $f(z) = z^n$, $f'(z) = nz^{n-1}$ everywhere

Suppose $u$ is an open set in $\mathbb{C}$, $z_{0}\in u$ and $f,g:u\to \mathbb{C}$ are differentiable at $z_{0}$
- Then $f+g$, $fg$, $\frac{f}{g}$(if $g(z_{0})\neq 0$), $f(g(z_{0}))$(Chain Rule) are exactly the same with real derivative!

## Entire
A function that is holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}$ is called **Entire**
- Polynomials are Entire

### Example
 For $f(z) = \bar{z}$
 $$\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}=\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\bar{z+h}-\bar{z}}{h} =\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\bar{z}+\bar{h}-\bar{z}}{h}$$
 $$=\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\bar{h}}{h}\implies DNE$$
 The function $f(z) = \bar{z}$ is not [[3. Functions of a Complex Variable#Example $ lim_{ z to 0 } frac{ bar{z}}{z}$|Complex-Differentiable]] at any point 

$\implies f:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}$
	$(x,y)\mapsto(x,-y)$

If we consider $f(z)$ as couple of real function of real number, then it seems differentiable, but *not complex-differentiable at all!*

# Derivative and Continuous
If $f: u\to\mathbb{C}$ is differentiable at $z_{0}$ it is continuous at $z_{0}$
- Consider $\lim_{z\to z_{0}}{f(z)}-f(z_{0})$
$$ = \lim_{z\to z_{0}}{\frac{f(z)-f(z_{0})}{z-z_{0}}}\cdot(z-z_{0})$$
$$ = \lim_{z\to z_{0}}{\frac{f(z)-f(z_{0})}{z-z_{0}}}\cdot\lim_{z\to z_{0}}{}(z-z_{0})$$
if both limits exists
$$f'(z_{0})\lim_{z\to z_{0}}{(z-z_{0})}=0$$

# Complex Differentiability
- If $f=u+vi:u\to\mathbb{C}$ is complex-differentiable at $z_{0}=x_{0}+iy_{0}$, then each of $u,v:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable(as $\mathbb{R}$- valued functions on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$)

Let $f:u\to\mathbb{C}$ be a complex differentiable function, and write $f(z) = u(x,y)+v(x,y)$

Since $f$ is complex differentiable, 
$$\lim_{h\to 0}{\frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}}$$
exists and equals to $f'(z)$

Since the limit exist, it is the same along any path to approach. In particular, if $h=t\in \mathbb{R}$
$$f'(z)=\lim_{t\to 0}{\frac{f(z+t)-f(z)}{t}}=\lim_{t\to 0}{\frac{{u(x+t,y)}+iv(x+t, y)-(u(x,y)+iv(x,y))}{t}}$$
- Since $z=x+yi$ and $t$ is real number
$$=\lim_{t\to 0}{\frac{u(x+t,y)-u(x,y)}{t}}+i\lim_{t\to 0}{\frac{v(x+t,y)-v(x,y)}{t}}$$
$$= \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+i\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$


Now let $h=it,t\in \mathbb{R}$, then $z+h = x+i(y+t)$
$$f'(z) = \lim_{t\to 0}{\frac{f(z+it)-f(z)}{it}}=\lim_{t\to 0}{\frac{u(x,y+t)+iv(x,y+t)-(u(x,y)+iv(x,y))}{it}}$$
$$\lim_{t\to 0}{\frac{u(x+yt)-u(x,y)}{it}}+\lim_{t\to 0}{\frac{i(u(x,y+t)-v(x,y))}{it}} = \frac{1}{i}\cdot\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$$
$$=\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}-i\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$$

Thus, if $f$ is complex-differentiable, 
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$$
- Cauchy-Reimann Equation
- This is a *necessary condition* of Complex-differentiable
## Examples
### 1. $f(z) = z^{2}$
$f(z)=z^{2}$
$(x+iy)^{2}= x^{2}-y^{2}+2ixy$
$u(x,y)=(x^{2}-y^{2}), v(x,y)=2ixy$
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2x, \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 2y$$
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -2y, \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 2x$$
$\to$ C-R Equation satisfied: Complex-Differentiable


### 2. $f(z) = \bar{z}$
Let $f(z) = \bar{z} = x-yi\implies u(x,y)=x, v(x,y)=-y$
$$\frac{\partial u}{{\partial x}}=1, \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=-1 \implies\frac{\partial u}{{\partial x}}\neq \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$$

$\to$ Not Complex-Differentiable

### 3. $f(z)=|z|^{2}$
$u(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}, v(x,y)=0$
$$\frac{\partial  u}{\partial x} = 2x, \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=2y, \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0$$

$\to$ Not satisfying except $x=y=0$
	this function is not Complex Differentiable anywhere except maybe $z=0$
	
## Proposition
If $f:(D \subseteq \mathbb{C} )\to\mathbb{R}$ is holomorphic and $D$ is open and connected, it is constant

write $f=u+iv$; if $f$ is real-valued then $v=0$

$\to$ Then the C-R Equations imply $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=0=\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$, which implies $u=$ constant 

Let $D\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2}$ be a domain(open & connected) and let $g:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}$ be differentiable in the real-variable sense. If $\vec{\triangledown}g=0$ on $D$, $g$ is constant on $D$.
- Not that $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}=0=\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}$ implies $g$ is constant along any horizontal and vertical line. So connected implies join any two points by a path $\implies$ approximate path by "stair case" $\implies$ $g$ is constant along path

# Complex Differentiability Continue
A function $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ is complex-differentiable at $z_{0}\in\mathbb{C}$ iff it is real-differentiable at $z_{0}$(as a function $\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}^{2}$), and satisfies the C-R equations at $z_{0}$

Let function $f=u+iv:u\subseteq \mathbb{C}$. 
1. Suppose the first partial derivative of $u,v$ exists on open set $u$, and continuous at $z_{0}\in u$
2. Satisfy C-R Equation at $z_{0}$

then $f$ is Complex-Differentiable at $z_{0}$, furthermore, it is holomorphic in $u$

## Example: $e^{z}$
$$e^{z} = e^{x+iy}=e^{x}e^{iy} = e^{x}(\cos y+i\sin y)$$$$u=e^{x}\cos y, v=e^{x}\sin y$$
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = e^{x}\cos y, \frac{\partial  v}{\partial  y} = e^{x}\cos y$$
$$\frac{\partial  u}{\partial u}=-e^{x}\sin y, \frac{\partial  v}{\partial  x}=e^{x}\sin y$$

These functions are all continuous for all $x,y$ and satisfy C-R equation, $e^{z}$ is holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}$

## What is the actual Derivative?
$$f'(z) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+i\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$
 $\to$ The expression $\frac{d}{dz}e^{z} = e^{z}$ holds in $\mathbb{C}$
1. $\frac{d}{dz}e^{cz} = ce^{cz}$ for $c\in \mathbb{C}$
2. $\frac{d}{dz}e^{g(z)} = g'(x)e^{g(x)}$ for any holomorphic $g$

$\to$ Can any $\mathbb{R}$-valued function of two real variable be the real part of a holomorphic function?
- For any function $u(x,y)$, is there a function $v(x,y)$ that make $f$ a holomorphic

# Laplace Equation
For some real function $u(x,y)$, is there another real function $v(x,y)$, such that $f=u+vi$ is holomorphic? Then, what is it?

According to C-R Equation
$$\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$$$$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$$
If $v$ exists as real function, its second order mixed partial derivative has to be the same. Then, 
$$\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right) = \frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right)=\frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}$$
$$ \frac{\partial }{\partial y}\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \right)= \frac{\partial }{\partial y}\left(-\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)= -\frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}$$
$$\implies \frac{\partial ^{2}v}{\partial x\partial y} = \frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}= -\frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}$$
$$\therefore \frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}} = 0$$
- This function is called **Laplace Function**

# Harmonic Function
A function $u$ that satisfies Laplace function (in some domain $D$) is called **harmonic**

If $f(z) = u+iv$ is holomorphic, then $u$ and $v$ are harmonic
- It is **necessary condition**
- A necessary condition that $u$ be real part holomorphic function

### Example
1) Let $u=x^{2}-y^{2}$

2) Let $u=e^{x}\cos y$

3) Let $u=log(x^{2}+y^{2})$

## Harmonic Conjugate
If $u$ is harmonic function, a harmonic function $v$ such that $u+iv$ is holomorphic, is called **harmonic conjugate** of $u$
- We can find harmonic conjugate by integrating C-R equation

### Example
$u(x,y)=x^{2}-y^{2}-2$
$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2x=\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\implies v=2xy+h(x) \implies \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 2y+h'(x)$

$\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -2y-1 \implies \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 2y+h'(x) = 2y+1$
$\implies h'(x) = 1, h(x) = x+c$
So $v(x,y)=2xy+x+c$

Thus, $f(x)=x^{2}-y^{2}-y-i(2xy+x+c)=z^{2}+iz+ic$

# Geometry of Complex Differentiation

What does it mean for function $f:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}^{2}$ to be differentiable?
- Look at $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is differentiable at a if $\lim_{h\to 0}{\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}$ exists, called $f'(a)$
- If both $f$ and $h$ are in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ they are vector, but we can't divide vector

One way to think: $f(a+h)=f(a)+hf'(a)$
- Linear approximation: good approximation
- Extend: $f(a+h)=f(a)+hf'(a)+\epsilon(h)$ where $\frac{\epsilon(h)}{h}\to {0}$ as $h\to 0$
![[Pasted image 20240220203000.png|500]]
	- $f'(a)$ is like a multiplier

## Meaning in Geometry
- A function that is C-differentiable at $z_{0}$ locally look like a multiplication by $f'(a)$, 
	- i.e. Scale by $|a+bi|$ and rotate by $arg(a+bi)$
		- **Note:** This maintain *square grid* 
![[Pasted image 20240220204102.png|600]]

### Example: $f(z)=\bar{z}$
Why $f(z)=\bar{z}$ is not differentiable?
![[Pasted image 20240220205107.png|500]]
- Since this is not a rotation, $f$ is not differentiable

### Example: $f(z)=z^{2}$
![[Pasted image 20240220210342.png|600]]
- To get $\vec{k}$ from $\vec{h}$, multiply by $f'(z_{0})=2r e^{i \theta}=2z_{0}$
	1. Rotate by $\theta$
	2. Scale by $2r$
- $|h|=r \cdot\delta$, then $|k|=r^{2}\cdot 2\delta=2r\cdot r\delta=2r|h|$ 

## Differentiability in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
If $f:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}^{2}$, $a\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$, we say $f$ is differentiable at $a$ if 
$$f(a+\vec{h})=f(a)+[Df]_{a}\vec{h}+\text{"error term" }\epsilon(h)$$
### $[Df]_{a}$
- Takes vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and return vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
- Should be linear
$\implies$ "Derivative" $[Df]_{a}$ is a linear transformation $\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}^{2}$

where $\frac{| |\epsilon(h)| |}{| |h| |}\to 0$ as $h\to 0$

Fact: If we write $f$ as $\vec{f}(x,y)=(f_{1}(x,y), f_{2}(x,y))$ then
$$[Df]=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x}&\frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial y} \\
\frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x}&\frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial y}
\end{bmatrix}$$
![[Pasted image 20240220212410.png|600]]

## What if $f$ is a holomorphic function?
$$f(z)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$$
$$\to f(x,y)=(u(x,y),v(x,y))$$
Thus, 
$$[Df]=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}&\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}&\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
a&-b \\
b&a
\end{bmatrix}$$
by CR Equation

Locally, near $z_{0}$, $f$ acts like linear transformation $$\begin{bmatrix}
a&-b \\
b&a
\end{bmatrix} $$looks like multiplying $a+bi$. Therefore
$$\implies \begin{bmatrix}
a&-b \\
b & a
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
h \\
k
\end{bmatrix}$$ is equivalent to multiplication $(h+ki)(a+bi)$

Makes Sense: If $f$ is C-differentiable at $z_{0}$. write$$f(z_{0}+h)=f(z_{0})+f'(z_{0})h+\epsilon(h)$$
