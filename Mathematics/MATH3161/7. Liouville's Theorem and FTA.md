**Recall:** function is entire if the function is holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}$
- Polynomial, $e^{z}$, $\sin z$...

# Liouville's Theorem
*A bounded entire function is constant*
- This means the **value of entire function** is bounded

Which is absolutely not true in $\mathbb{R}$
- $\sin x$, $\arctan x$, etc...

## Proof
Suppose $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ is entire and $|f(z)|<M$ for all $z\in\mathbb{C}$

Pick some $w\in\mathbb{C}$ and let $C_{R}=\{|z-w|=R\}$

By CIF for derivatives, 
$$f'(\omega)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int^{}_{\gamma}\frac{f(\xi)}{(\xi-w)^{2}} d{\xi} $$
Then, by ML inequality,
$$|f'(\omega)|=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\left|\int^{}_{\gamma}\frac{f(\xi)}{(\xi-w)^{2}} d{\xi}\right|\leq\frac{1}{2\pi} \max_{\xi\in C_{R}}\left|\frac{f(\xi)}{(\xi-\omega)^{2}}\right|\cdot L(C_{R})$$
$$<\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{M}{R^{2}}\cdot 2\pi R=\frac{M}{R}$$

This is true for any value of $R$. As$R\to \infty,\frac{M}{R}\to 0$, but $f'(\omega)$ is just fixed
$\implies f'(\omega)=0$
Since $\omega$ was arbitrary, $f'=0$ on $\mathbb{C}$. Thus, $f$ is constant, by the

## proof
(Proof by contradiction)
Suppose not, i.e. $p(z)\neq 0$ for all $z\in\mathbb{C}$. Define $g(z)=\frac{1}{p(z)}$
Then $g(z)$ is entire
- Since $g(z)$ is rational, but there is no pole

Also, as $|z|\to \infty, |p(z)|\to \infty$
- This takes bit more time, not going to prove

So, $|g(z)|\to 0$ as $|z|\to \infty$
- This implies that $g(z)$ is bounded: For large enough $|z|$, $|g(z)|<1$
- Say, $|g(z)|<1$ for $|z|>R$

Let $M = \text{max }_{z\leq R} |g(z)|$ (Extreme Value Theorem)
- so then $|g(z)|\leq M$ $\forall z\in\mathbb{C}$

By Liouville's Theorem, $g(z)$ is constant, so $p(z)=\frac{1}{g(z)}$ is constant
