If $z,w \in \mathbb{C}$, the distance between is $|z-w|$
properties
- $|z-w|\geq0$ $\forall$ $z,w$
- $|z-w|=0$ $\iff$ $z=w$
- $|z-w|\leq|z-z_0|+|w-z_0|$ $\forall$ $z,z_{0}, w\in \mathbb{C}$ 

Basic concept
- The open disc of radius $r>0$ centred at $z_0\in C$ 
- Sometimes we just write "The disc $|z-z_0|<r$"

$D(z_{0}, r) = \{z\in\mathbb{C}$ |$|z-z_{0}|<r \}$

# Interior Points
Suppose $A \subseteq \mathbb{C}$. A point $z_{0} \in A$ is an **integer point** if there is some $r>0$ with $d(z_{0}, r)\subseteq A$

Let $H = \{z\in \mathbb{C}$ | $Re(z)>0\}$
![[Pasted image 20240117000803.png|200]]
$\to$ Every point in $H$ is interior points
`Proof Idea:` 
- Any $z_{0} = x_{0}+iy_{0}$ $\in H$ has $x_{0}>0$, Let $r=\frac{1}{2}x_{0}$, then $D(z_{0}, r) \subseteq H$

# Open Sets
A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is **open** if every point in $A$ is an interior point
- Every $z_{0} \in A$ has some $z>0$ with $D(z_{0}, r) \subseteq A$

Intuitively, this mean that every point has some disc around it that is entirely in the set
- *Every point has some room to take limit/differential*

## Proof
For any $z \in \mathbb{C}, |Re(z)|\leq z$
![[Pasted image 20240117002300.png|200]]

Proof: "If $|z-z_{0}|<r$, then $Re(z)>0$"

$Re(z-z_{0}) \leq|Re(z-z_{0})|\leq |z-z_{0}|\leq r$
$Re(z_{0})-Re(z)<r \to Re(z)>Re(z_{0}-r)$

Given $z\in D(z_{0}, r)$, need to show there is some $t>0$ with $D(z,t)\subseteq D(z_{0}, r)$
- Idea: look at $r-|z-z_{0}| = t$ show that if $|w-z|<t$ then $|w-z_{0}|<r$

# Limit Points
![[Pasted image 20240118161313.png|300]]
- Take any $z_{0}$ with $Im(z_{0}) = 1$
- Then any disc around $z_{0}$ will contain points not in $B$, so $z_{0}$ is not an interior point

- Given $A\subseteq \mathbb{C}$, a point $z_{0}\in\mathbb{C}$ is a **limit point** of $A$ if *every* disc around $z_{0}$ contains some point of $A$ other that $z_{0}$
	- $z_{0}$ maybe in $A$, or not
	- Every disc around $z_{0}$ contains infinitely many points of $A$
	- A limit point of $A$ are limit of sequence of distinct points in $A$
	- Interior point and their boundary are automatically the limit points

## Example
![[Pasted image 20240118155858.png]]
$$\{\frac{1}{n}|n\in \mathbb{N}\} = \{1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}\dots\}\subset \mathbb{R}$$
- 0 is a limit point, because every disc around 0 contains points $1/n$:

# Closed Set

A set $A\subseteq\mathbb{C}$ is **closed** if it contains all its limit points, and
$$\bar{D}(z_{0},r) = \{z\in \mathbb{C}| |z-z_{0}|\leq r\}$$
is called closed disc or radius $r$ and centered at $z_{0}$

Given $A\subseteq\mathbb{C}$, a point $z_{0}$ is a *boundary point* of $A$ if every open disc around $z_{0}$ contains points in $A$ and points in $A^{c}= \{z\in\mathbb{C}|z\not\in A\}$ is called a complement of $A$
- Doesn't need to be part of $A$
- Notation: $\partial A$
- $\partial A = \partial A^c$

$\to$ Set is open iff it contains *none* of its boundary points and closed iff it contains *all* of its boundary points

$\to$ if $z\in A$, then either $z$ is an interior point or $z$ is boundary point

# Alternative characteristic of closed
A set $A\subseteq\mathbb{C}$ is closed iff $A^c$ is open
## Proof

Let $z_{0}\in A^c$, wish to show $z_{0}$ is an interior point of $A^c$
- Since $A$ is closed, it contains all of its limit point, $z_{0}$ is not a limit point of $A$
- Therefore, there must be some disc $D(z_{0}, r)$ that contains no points of $A$(Otherwise $z_{0}$ would be a lmit point)
- But then $D(z_{0}, r)\subset A^c$ and thus $z_{0}$ is an interior point of $A^c$
- Since $z_{0}$ was arbitrary, every point of $A^c$ is an intetrior point, and $A^c$ is open

Opposite direction: Excersize

# Connected
- A set is "Connected" if it has "only one piece"
- A set $A\subseteq\mathbb{C}$ is connected(path-connected) if any two points in $A$ can be joined by a continuous path

![[Pasted image 20240118161137.png|400]]

# Domain
- A domain in $\mathbb{C}$ is an open, connected set
- A region in $\mathbb{C}$ is a domain, possibly together with some its boundary points

# Bounded
- A set $A\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is *bounded* it it lies inside some disc $D(0,R)$

# Compact
![[Pasted image 20240127170756.png|600]]
- A set $K\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is compact if it is closed and bounded
- Natural generalization of closed interval in $\mathbb{R}$
