# Definition
Suppose $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}\text{ or }\mathbb{C}$ and $A\in \mathcal{M}_{m,n}(\mathbb{F})$. Then there exist unitary matrices $U\in \mathcal{M}_{m}(\mathbb{F})$ and $V\in \mathcal{M}_{n}(\mathbb{F})$ and a diagonal matrix $\sum\in \mathcal{M}_{m,n}(\mathbb{R})$ with non-negative entries such that
$$A=U\Sigma V^{*}$$
Furthermore, the diagonal entries of $\sum$ (called singular values of $A$) are the non-negative square roots of the eigenvalues of $A^{*}A$

Pros
- Applies to **ALL** matrices
- $\sum$ is diagonal, with non-negative real entries

**Proof)**
Consider matrix $A^{*}A$ and assume that $m \geq n$
- If $m<n$, use $AA^{*}$

Since $A^{*}A$ is PSD, $A^{*}A=VDV^{*}$ for some unitary $V$ and real non-negative diagonal $D$ by spectral decomposition

Pick $\sum=\sqrt{ D }$ with $m-n$ extra zero rows on the bottom

Then, $(\Sigma V^{*})^{*}(\Sigma V^{*})=V\Sigma^{*}\Sigma V^{*}=VDV^{*}=A^{*}A$
- By theorem
