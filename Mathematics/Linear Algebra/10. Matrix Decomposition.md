Matrix Decompositions are ways of writing down a matrix as a product of matrices, such as diagonalization

If $A\in \mathcal{M}_{n}(\mathbb{F})$ then the following are equivalent
- $\exists \text{ }P,D\in \mathcal{M}_{n}(\mathbb{F})$ s.t $A=PDP^{-1}$ where $P$ is invertible and $D$ is diagonal
- There is a basis of $\mathbb{F}^{n}$ consisting of eigenvectors of $A$

Q) How close to diagonal can $D$ be if we require that $P$ is unitary?

# Schur Triangularization
Suppose $A \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Then there exists a unitary matrix $U \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ and an upper triangular matrix $T \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ such that  
$$A = U T U^*$$

**Proof)** 
Proof by induction on the size of $A$

For the base case, we simply notice that the result is trivial if $n = 1$: every $1 \times 1$ matrix is upper triangular.

Assume that theorem is true for matrices in $M_{n-1}(\mathbb{C})$. 
Let $A \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$, and let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\vec{u} \in \mathbb{C}^n$ be an eigenvalue/vector pair 
- (i.e., $Aa = \lambda a$) with $\|\vec{u}\| = 1$.

Let $U = [\vec{u} \mid V]$ for some $V \in M_{n,n-1}(\mathbb{C})$ that makes $U$ unitary.
- We can apply Gram-Schmidt to find $V$
- This means that $\vec{u}$ and all column vectors in $V$ are orthogonal

Let's compute $U^*AU$:

$U^*AU = [\vec{u} \mid V]^*A[\vec{u} \mid V] = \begin{bmatrix}\vec{u}^* \\V^*\end{bmatrix}A\,[\vec{u} \mid V]$

$= \begin{bmatrix}\vec{u}^* \\V^*\end{bmatrix}[A\vec{u} \mid AV] = \begin{bmatrix}\vec{u}^*A\vec{u} & \vec{u}^*AV \\V^*A\vec{u} & V^*AV\end{bmatrix}$
- Each entry is block matrix multiplication
- Consider bottom-left entry
	- $A\vec{u} = \lambda \vec{u}$
	- Then, $\lambda V^{*}\vec{u}$
	- Each entry of $V^{*}\vec{u}$ is a dot product of row vectors of $V^{*}$(column vectors of $V$). Since $V$'s column vectors are orthogonal to $\vec{u}$, each entry will be zero
	- $\therefore V^{*}\vec{u}=\vec{0}$

$= \begin{bmatrix}\vec{u}^*A\vec{u} &\vec{u}^*AV \\\vec{0} & V^*AV\end{bmatrix}$

$=\begin{bmatrix} *&*&*&\dots&*\\0&*&*&\dots&* \\ \vdots & \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots \\ 0&*&*&\dots&*\end{bmatrix}$
