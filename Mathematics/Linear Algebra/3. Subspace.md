# Definition
The subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is non-empty set of vectors $S$ with the following properties
1. $\vec{0}\in S$
2. If $\vec{v}, \vec{u}\in S$, then $\vec{v}+\vec{u}\in S$
3. If $\vec{u}\in S$, then $c \vec{u}\in S$

Looks like a straight plane or line passing the origin that as long as one vector is on the plane, it never go out of subspace respect vector addition of scalar multiplication
- In $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
	- $\vec{0}$
	- Lines through origin
	- $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
- In $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
	-  $\vec{0}$
	- Lines through origin
	- Planes through origin
	- $\mathbb{R}^{3}$

# Theorem
Let $\vec{v}=\{ v_{1},v_{2}\dots v_{k} \}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $\text{span}(\vec{v})$ is subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$

**Proof)**
i) $\vec{0}\in\text{span}(\vec{v})$
$0\cdot v_{1}+0\cdot v_{2}\dots 0\cdot v_{k}=0$

ii) If $\vec{w}, \vec{u}\in \text{span}(\vec{v})$, then $\vec{w}+\vec{u}\in \text{span}(\vec{v})$
Since $\vec{w}\in\text{span}(\vec{v})$ and $\vec{u}\in\text{span}(\vec{v})$, there is some scalars $c_{i}$ and $d_{i}$ such that
- $\vec{u}=c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}\dots c_{k}v_{k}$
- $\vec{w}=d_{1}v_{1}+d_{2}v_{2}\dots d_{k}v_{k}$

Then, by vector addition,
$\vec{u}+\vec{w}=(c_{1}+d_{1})v_{1}+(c_{2}+d_{2})v_{2}\dots(c_{k}+d_{k})v_{k}$
- Since $c_{i}+d_{i}\in\mathbb{R}$, $\vec{u}+\vec{w}\in\text{span}(\vec{v})$

iii) If $\vec{u}\in \text{span}(\vec{v})$, then $c \vec{u}\in \text{span}(\vec{v})$
Since $\vec{u}\in\text{span}(\vec{v})$, $\vec{u}=c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}\dots c_{k}v_{k}$
- Then, $c\vec{u}=c\cdot c_{1}v_{1}+c\cdot c_{2}v_{2}\dots c\cdot c_{k}v_{k}$
- Since $c\cdot c_{i}\in\mathbb{R}$, $c \vec{u}\in\text{span}(\vec{v})$

# Special Subspaces
1. Row Space
	- $\text{row}(A)$
	- Spanned by rows of $A$
2. Column Space (Range)
	- $\text{col}(A)$
	- Spanned by the columns of $A$
3. Null Space (Kernel)
	- $\text{null}(A)$
	- Set of all solutions to the $[A\text{ | }0]$

## Prove) Null Space is a subspace
i) $\vec{0}\in\text{null}(A)$?
- $\vec{0}$ is solution to the $[A\text{ | }0]$

ii) If $\vec{u}, \vec{v}\in\text{null(A)}$, then is $\vec{u}+\vec{v}\in\text{null}(A)$?
- Then, $A \vec{u}=\vec{0}$ and $A\vec{v}=\vec{0}$
- $A(\vec{v}+\vec{u}) = A\vec{v}+A\vec{u} = \vec{0}+\vec{0}=\vec{0}$

iii) If $\vec{u}\in\text{null}(A)$, then is $c\vec{u}\in\text{null}(A)$?
- $A\vec{u} = \vec{0}$
- $A(c\vec{u})=c\cdot A\vec{u} = c\cdot\vec{0}=\vec{0}$

# Basis
A Basis of Subspace $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a smallest set of vectors $V$ such that
1. Spans $S$ : $\text{span}(V)=S$
2. $V$ is linearly independent (Ensuring the smallest set)

The idea of a basis is that it is a set that is big enough to span the subspace, but it is not so big that it contains redubdancies
- A space can have more than one basis

**Ex)**
Standard Basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ = Standard Basis Vector: $\{ \vec{e_{1}}, \vec{e_{2}}\dots \vec{e_{n}} \}$

## How can we find the basis of subspace?
**Ex)**
Find a basis for $\text{span}(\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w})$ where
- $\vec{u}=[3,-1,5]$
- $\vec{v}=[2,1,3]$
- $\vec{w}=[0,-5,1]$

Note: it is a spanning set, it is subspace

Check whether $\vec{v}, \vec{u}, \vec{w}$ are linearly independent
- $c_{1}\vec{u}+c_{2}\vec{v}+c_{3}\vec{w}=0$
$$\begin{bmatrix}
3&2&0&|&0 \\
-1&1&-5&|&0 \\
5&3&1&|&0
\end{bmatrix}$$
$$=\begin{bmatrix}
1&0&2&|&0 \\
0&1&-3&|&0 \\
0&0&0&|&0
\end{bmatrix}$$
They are not linearly independent
- Since $\vec{w}$ is redundant, $\text{span}(\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w})=\text{span}(\vec{v}, \vec{u})$
- And $\text{span}(\vec{v}, \vec{u})$ is linearly independent, thus it is a basis

## Dimension
The number of vectors in a basis of $S$ is called the Dimension of $S$
- Every basis of subspace has same Dimension
- $\text{dim}(\emptyset)=0$ / $\text{dim}(\mathbb{R}^{n})=n$

## Basis Theorem: Any basis of subspace $S$ have the same Dimension
Let $B=[u_{1},u_{2}\dots u_{r}]$ and $C=[v_{1},v_{2}\dots v_{t}]$ are basis of some subspace $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$
- We want to prove $r=t$
- Will show that $r<t$ and $t<r$ is impossible

i) If $r<t$
Consider $c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}\dots c_{t}v_{t}=0$
- Since $B$ is a basis for $S$ and each $v_{i}\in S$, $v_{i}$ can be written as a linear combinations of $u_{j}$'s

## Additional Propositions
### 1. Every Finite Dimensional subspace has a basis
### 2. Every Non-zero subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ has a basis
Special Case : $\text{dim}(\vec{0})=0$

**Proof)**
Let $S$ be non-zero subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
- Then, pick the largest possibily linearly independent set of vectors in $S$ and call this set $B=\{ \vec{v_{1}}, \vec{v_{2}}\dots \vec{v_{m}} \}$

Since $S$ is non-zero subspace, take $\vec{x}\in S\text{ } (\vec{x}\neq \vec{0})$
- Then $\{ \vec{x} \}$ is linearly independent, thus we have found that $S$ contains at least one linearly independent set
- Thus, there has to be one that has the most number of elements

By [[2. Linear System#Theorems about Linear Independence|4th of Theorem of Linearly Independent]], any set of $k$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is linearly dependent if $k>n$
- Thus, suppose $m \leq n$, then $B$ is linearly independent

Since $B\subseteq S$, $\text{span}(B)\subseteq S$
- Subspace is so closed under linear combination of any est of its element, linear combinations of elements of $S$

Now, pick arbitrary $\vec{w}\in S$, if $\vec{w}\in\text{span}(B)$, then $S\subseteq\text{span}(B)$, thus $S=\text{span}(B)$ as we wanted

Consider a set $\{ \vec{w}, B \}=\{ \vec{w}, \vec{v_{1}}, \vec{v_{2}}\dots \vec{v_{m}} \}$ with $m+1$ elements
- This set must be linearly dependent since $m$ is the size of the largest linearly independent set in $S$
- Thus, $\exists \text{ }$scalars $d$ and $c_{i}$'s, not all zero, such that
$$d\vec{w}+c_{1}\vec{v_{1}}+c_{2}\vec{v_{2}}\dots+c_{m}\vec{v_{m}}=0$$

If $d=0$, then we'd have $c_{1}\vec{v_{1}}+c_{2}\vec{v_{2}}\dots+c_{m}\vec{v_{m}}=0$
- Since $\vec{v_{1}}, \vec{v_{2}}\dots \vec{v_{m}}$ is linearly independent, $c_{i}$'s must be zero, which contradicts that they are not zero
- Thus, $d\neq 0$

By dividing $d$ to both sides
$$\vec{w}=-\frac{c_{1}}{d}\vec{v_{1}}-\frac{c_{2}}{d}\vec{v_{2}}\dots-\frac{c_{m}}{d}\vec{v_{m}}$$
- Since $\vec{v}$ is linear combination of $\vec{v_{1}}, \vec{v_{2}}\dots \vec{v_{m}}$, $\vec{w}\in\text{span}(B)$

Therefore, $\text{span}(B)=S$
- Since $B$ satisfies all condition for basis, $B$ is a basis for $S$
- As a result, for any non-zero subspace $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$, it has a basis

### 3. Every finite dimension subspace has a basis

### 4. If $\text{dim}(S)=n$, any set of vectors $T\subseteq S$ has less than $n$ vectors cannot span $S$, $\text{span}(T)\subset S$
Suppose for contradiction) $\text{span}(T)=S$

i) $T$ is linearly independent
Then, $T$ is a basis for $S$. But the number of elements in $T$ is less than $n$, contradicts the basis theorem

ii) $T$ is linearly dependent
So there is at least one element of $T$ that can be written as linear combination of other vectors of $T$
- Let it $\vec{v_{1}}$, and let $T'=T\text{ / }\{\vec{v}\}$
- Then, $T'$ is either linearly independent or dependent
	- If it is linearly independent, then contradicts similarly to i)
	- If it is linearly dependent, then do similar process like ii)

At worst case, there would be only one vector left in the set, which is any linearly independent
- Thus, anyway it will eventually become linearly independent, which contradicts like i)
