# Definition
The subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is non-empty set of vectors $S$ with the following properties
1. $\vec{0}\in S$
2. If $\vec{v}, \vec{u}\in S$, then $\vec{v}+\vec{u}\in S$
3. If $\vec{u}\in S$, then $c \vec{u}\in S$

Looks like a straight plane or line passing the origin that as long as one vector is on the plane, it never go out of subspace respect vector addition of scalar multiplication
- In $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
	- $\vec{0}$
	- Lines through origin
	- $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
- In $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
