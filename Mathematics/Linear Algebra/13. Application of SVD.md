# Pseudoinverse
Suppose $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}\text{ or }\mathbb{C}$, and $A\in \mathcal{M}_{m,n}(\mathbb{F})$ has SVD
$$A=U\Sigma V^{*}$$
Then, the pseudoinverse of $A^\dagger$, denoted by , is the matrix
$$A^\dagger=V\Sigma^\dagger U^{*}$$
where 
$$\Sigma^\dagger=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{\sigma_{1}}&0&\dots&0&\dots&0\\
0&\frac{1}{\sigma_{2}}&\dots&0&\dots&0 \\
\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots &&0 \\
0&0&\dots &\frac{1}{\sigma_{n}}&\dots&0
\end{bmatrix}$$
- If $\sigma_{i}=0$, then $[\Sigma^{^{\dagger}}]_{j,j}=0$

## Notes
If $A$ is invertible, then $A^{-1}=A^{^{\dagger}}$

The pseudoinverse is well-defined
- Even though SVD is not unique, $A^{^{\dagger}}$ is

## Theorem 10.1 Pseudoinverses Solve Linear System
Suppose $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{C}$, $A \in \mathcal{M}_{m,n}(\mathbb{F})$, and suppose that the system of linear equations $Ax = b$ has at least one solution. Then, $$\vec{x} = A^\dagger\vec{b}$$ is a solution. Furthermore, if $y$ is any other solution, then $\|A^\dagger b\| \leq \|y\|$.
- It is the smallest solution

### If there is no solution in the system?
Pseudoinverse gives the best non-solution, meaning that it gives the closest thing to a solution
## Theorem 10.2 Linear Least Squares
Suppose $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{C}$, $A \in \mathcal{M}_{m,n}(\mathbb{F})$, and $b \in \mathbb{F}^m$. If $x = A^\dagger b$ then $$\|Ax - b\| \leq \|Ay - b\|$$ for all $y \in \mathbb{F}^n$.

## Summary
If $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ has a uniques solution, then $x=A^{^{\dagger}}\vec{b}$
If $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ has infinitely many solution, then $x=A^{^{\dagger}}\vec{b}$ is one and it is the smallest one
If $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ has no solution, then $x=A^{^{\dagger}}\vec{b}$ is the closest thing to a solution
