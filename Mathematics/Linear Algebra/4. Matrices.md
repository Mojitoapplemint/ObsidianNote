# Theorem
Let $A$ be a matrix and $B$ for any matrix you can get to after finite number of element row operations from $A$. Then, $$\text{row}(A)=\text{row}(B)$$
**Proof)**
Rows of $B$ are linear combinations of rows of $A$, so regroup anything in $\text{row}(B)$ to be linear combinations of $\text{row}(A)$
- $\text{row}(B)\subseteq\text{row}(A)$
