$$\begin{bmatrix}

An $n\times m$ matrix is a 2D array of numbers with $n$ rows and $m$ columnes. The row and column must line up each other and spot in the matrix must have an entry
- $a_{ij}$ : The element at $i$'th row and $j$'th column
- Shorter way to denote metrix: $A=[a_{ij}]$
- Two matrices are the same if 
## Kinds of Matrix
1. Square Matrix
	- When $n=m$
	- $a_{ii}$ is called diagonal entries
2. Identity Matrix
	- 1's along the diagonal, 0's everywhere else
	- Always Square
	- Denoted as $I_{n}$
	- Ex) $I_{3}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}$
3. Zero Matrix
	- All entries are 0
	- Doesn't have to be square
