# Linear Equation
A linear equation of variables $x_{1}, x_{2}\dots x_{n}$ is an equation of the form
$$a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\dots+a_{n}x_{n}=b$$
where $a_{i}'s$ and $b$ called coefficient, $b$ sometimes called constant

## Vector $\longleftrightarrow$ Linear Equations
Linear Equation represent flat or straight things
- $\mathbb{R}^{2}\implies$ Line
- $\mathbb{R}^{3}\implies$ Planes
- $\mathbb{R}^{4}\implies$ HyperPlane

# System of Linear Equations (Linear System)
Finite set of linear equations over the same variable
- Solution of the system is a vector that simultaneously satisfies all the linear equation
	- The solution set is the set of all solutions
	- In vector system, the solution of the system is a vector which starts at $(0,0)$ and ends at the intersaction of the system
- A linear system is consistent if the solution is non-empty, otherwise, it is consistent

# Matrices
An $n\times m$ matrix is an collection of elements in in $n$ rows and $m$ columns, enclosed in square brackets
- Vectors are $n\times1$ matrices

## Converting Linear System to Matrices
Each row correspond to an equation, each column corresponeds to a variable
- The entries are coefficient of the system

**Augmented Matrix**
- Contains the coefficients, the line, and the constant terms

**Coefficient Matrix**
- Augmented Matrix is without line and constant

# Equivalent System
Two linear systems are equivalent, if they have the same solution
- They are consistent solution since the solution exists

# Elementary Row Operation
Ultimate Goal: Convert the matrix into Row Echelon Form(REF) or Row Reduced Echelon Form(R/REF)
1. Interchange two rows
2. Multiply a row by non-zero scalar
3. Add a multiple of a row to another 


# Row Echelon Form(REF)
1. All rows consisting entirely of zeros are below the non-zero rows
2. In each non-zero row, the first non-zero entry(Leading Entry) is to the left of any leading entries below
	- Any non-leading variable that is not constant can be checked by R/REF

**Ex)**
$$\begin{bmatrix}
1&2&3&|& 4 \\
0&5&6&|&7 \\
0&0&8&|&9
\end{bmatrix}$$

System with no solution
- Matrix that one of the row is $\begin{bmatrix} 0&0&\dots&0&|&c \end{bmatrix}$ where $c\neq0$
