# Linear Equation
A linear equation of variables $x_{1}, x_{2}\dots x_{n}$ is an equation of the form
$$a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\dots+a_{n}x_{n}=b$$
where $a_{i}'s$ and $b$ called coefficient, $b$ sometimes called constant

## Vector $\longleftrightarrow$ Linear Equations
Linear Equation represent flat or straight things
- $\mathbb{R}^{2}\implies$ Line
- $\mathbb{R}^{3}\implies$ Planes
- $\mathbb{R}^{4}\implies$ HyperPlane

# System of Linear Equations (Linear System)
Finite set of linear equations over the same variable
- Solution of the system is a vector that simultaneously satisfies all the linear equation
	- The solution set is the set of all solutions
	- In vector system, the solution of the system is a vector which starts at $(0,0)$ and ends at the intersaction of the system
- A linear system is consistent if the solution is non-empty, otherwise, it is consistent
