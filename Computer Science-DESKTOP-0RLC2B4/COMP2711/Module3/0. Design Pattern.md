# Design Pattern

```
Each Pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again. And then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without doing it the same way twice.
```

**Design patterns will not generate ready code, but provide a template to follow**
- Descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general problem in a particular context
	- Help make software more flexible and reusable
- Describe solution to the design problems that occur over and over again
- Record design decisions, alternatives, and trade-offs gained from experience

- Decoupling of classes or objects: Something can be changed without changing something else
	- Patterns let some aspect of the system vary independently
	- Makes system more robust to a particular kind of change
- Makes elements in a pattern specialized in one thing and don't know much about anything else

# Creational Design Pattern

- [[Factory Method]]
- [[Singleton]]

# Structural Design Pattern
 Deals with how **inheritance and composition** can be used to *provide extra functionality*
- [[Composite]]
- [[Decorator]]
- [[Facade]]

# Behavioural Design Pattern
