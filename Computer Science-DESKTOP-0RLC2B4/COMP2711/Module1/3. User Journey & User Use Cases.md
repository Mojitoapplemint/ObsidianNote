- Technique for capturing the *functional requirements* of a system
	- Describes what your system does to accomplish a particular customers goal
- Set of scenarios tied together by a *common user goal*
- Represent External view of the system

# Terminology
- `Scenario`: A sequence of steps describing an interaction between a user and a system
- `Actor`: Role that a user plays with respect to the system
	- Not a class
	- One actor and perform many use cases, and one use case can contain many actors
	- One person may act more than one actor
	- Doesn't need to be human(ex, computer system, etc)
- `Primary Actor`: Actor with the goal the use case is trying to satisfying
	- Usually the initiator of the use case
	- Calls on the system to deliver a service
- `Secondary Actor`: Other actors that the system communicate while carrying out the use case

# User Journey
Series of steps which represent a scenario in which a **user might interact** with the thing you are designing(What user experience)
- Doesn't depend upon the implementation, so can be developed before the implementation
- Can be carried back to the clients to make sure the users and the developers have the same ideas
- Each Step has to be connected, not assuming previous step is already done

$\to$ Demonstrating the way users **currently/could interact** with the service or product

### MSS and Extension
- Pick one of the scenarios as the **Main Success Scenario**
- And take other scenario and write them as **extension**
	1. Provide short description of the extensive condition
	2. Follow the condition with numbered steps in the same style as the MSS
	3. Describe where it returns to the MSS, if it does

### Example

## Additional Information
As well as the steps in the scenarios, you can add some other common information to a use case
- `pre-condition`: What the system should ensure is true **before** the system allows the use case to begin
	- Tells programmer what conditions they don't have to check
- `Guarantee`: What the system should ensure is true at the **end** of the use case 
- `Trigger`: Specifies the event that gets the use case started

# Levels of Use Cases
Indicate the level at the top of the use case
- `System Use Case`: Interaction with the software
	- `Sea Level`: Discrete interaction between primary actor and the system
	- `Fish Level`: Use cases that exists only because they are included by sea-level
- `Business Use Case`: How business responds to a customer or an event
	- `Kite Level`: Show how the sea-level use cases fit into wider business interaction

## Pieces of a Use Case
- `External Initiator`: Kicks off the step described in the use case
- `Start Condition`: Always the first step in the use case
- `Stop Condition`: Lets you know when a use case is finished
- `Clear Value`: Without this, a use case isn't worth anything to anyone; use case without this always fail
- `Main Path`: How a system works when everything is going well. This is usually what customers describe when they're talking about the system

## Requirement
- Ensure the system works like customers expect
- Make sure to cover all the steps in the use cases for your system
- Find out things that customer forgot to tell you
- Reveal any incomplete or missing requirement that you might have to add to your system

### Features
- Chunking up a system for planning an **iterative project**
	- Each iteration delivers a number of features

## How to find it?
1. Choose the system boundary
	- Is it just a software application, the hardware and application as a unit, that plus a person using it, or an entire organization
2. Identify the primary actors, namely, those that have goals fulfilled through using services of the system
3. Identify the goal for each primary actor
4. Define use cases that satisfy user goals, name them according to their goal

## Use Case Specification Templates

```
When adding the additional path, we need to update use case, but not entirely replace the original one, but might use it as a back up plan if the additional path doesn't work
```
## Use Cases Diagram
Shows actors and use cases and the relationships between them
- Which actors carry out which use cases
- Which use cases include other use cases

Actors are not in the system(Square Box)
- Actors that can *make a certain action* to the system locates **left**	
- Actors that *responses to the action* from the system locates **right**

- Group the operator action to the top

- Draw in logical order, from top to bottom

Extending action
- Happens only certain requirement satisfies, otherwise don't
- Arrow **From** Extending Action **to** Base Use Case

Including action
- Action that Base use cases requires first
- Arrow **From** Base Use Case **to** Included Action
