One type of [[2. UML Indoctrination|UML Diagram]]
- Allow to build up the vocabulary of your domain
- Feature attributes and operations of each class
- Indicate generalization(inheritance), association, multiplicity
- Not including the data structure
# Class
![[Pasted image 20240125143058.png]]
- Name is represented as a simple rectangle
- Each compartment is name, variables, and methods
	- `-`: Private
	- `+`: Public
	- `#`: Protected
- Type of parameter is shown after the name of the argument/variable
- Return value of method shows after the colon

## Inner Class
![[Pasted image 20240125164132.png|500]]
- Represented with an association adorned with a crossed circle

## Abstract Class
![[Pasted image 20240125145025.png|400]]
- Either class or method can be abstract
- Name in *italic*, or use `{abstract}` property

## Association Classes
![[Pasted image 20240125164400.png|500]]
- The diagram doesn't tell us what kind of container class is used
- Association Class show how a particular association is implemented
- Also used to indicate special forms of reference

## Class Stereotypes
### Interface
- Use notation `<<interface>>`
- All methods are abstract
	- None of them can be implemented
- Can have no instance variable
	- Or static variables

### Utility
![[Pasted image 20240125144852.png|500]]
- All methods and variables are **static**

# Associations
![[Pasted image 20240125143306.png]]
- Represent instance variables that *holds the reference* of other objects
	- `Phone class holds reference to Button`
- Number near the arrow head tells multiplicities(# references)

## Multiplicities
- An indication of how many objects may fill the properties
	- `Digit.`: Exact number of elements
	- `(minimum)..(maximum)`: any number between min and max
	- `* / 0..*`: Zero to many
	- `1..*`: One to many
	- If there is no number, then 1 as a default

## Composition
![[Pasted image 20240125161922.png]]
- Non-shared association
- "Part-of" relationship, having strong dependency between two classes
	- When first class deleted, then second deleted as a result
	- When first class is copied, then second is copied as well
	- Target class can't be simultaneously owned by two classes

## Aggregation
![[Pasted image 20240125161935.png]]
- "Whole/part" relationship
- There is no such cycles of aggregation

$\rightarrow$ Avoid using aggregation. Often referred to as shared association, often misused and confused with association

## Association Stereotype
- `<<create>>`: Target is created by the source
- `<<local>>`: Source class creates an instance of the target and **holds in a local variable**
- `<<parameter>>`: Source class gains access to the target instance through the parameter of one its member function
- `<<delegate>>`: Source class forwards a member function invocation to the target

## Association Qualifiers
![[Pasted image 20240125165141.png|500]]
- When the association is implemented through some kind of key or token, instead of with normal Java reference

# Generalization(Inheritance)
![[Pasted image 20240125144220.png]]       ![[Pasted image 20240125144231.png|130]]
- Identify the similarities and differences between classes
- Arrow heads points the base class
- Inheritance to interface use dashed line

## Generalization vs Classification
- Use "is a" test, and combine the phrases
- **Generaliztion is transitive**, classification is not
- Can combine a classification followed by a generalization but not vise versa

# Examples
![[Pasted image 20240124125745.png|500]]
1. No two companies can have the same name
	- True
2. No two employees can have the same name
	- False
3. No two companies can be at the same address
	- True
4. No two employees can work at the same address
	- False

![[Pasted image 20240124130228.png|400]]
1. Min/Max # of instructor for one course
	- Min: 1(1profs) / Max: 5(3 profs+ 2 TAs)
2. Min/Max # of course for one professor
	- Min: 0 / Max 1 (Based on the multiplicities associating with Course class)
3. Min/Max # of course for one TA
	- Min: 3 / Max 6 (Based on the multiplicities associating with Course class)
