# Syllogism
Arguments that consist of two premises and a conclusion
- Each of the statements is a categorical statement
- A statement that asserts a connection between two categories, a subject and a predicate
	- "All (subject) are (predicate)"

**Ex)**
1. All animals of the dog family are carnivore
2. Foxes are animals belonging to the dog family
3. Therefore, foxes are carnivores

All D are C
All F are D
$\therefore$ All F are C

## A, E, I, O Statements
Four types of statements, two of which affirm some relationship between categories and two which deny
- A, I: Affirm
- E, O: Deny

### A: Universal Affirmative
"All A's are B's"
- Contradictory with O

### E: Universal Negative
"No A's are B's"
- Contraictory with I

### I: Particular Affirmative
"Some A's are B's"
- Contradictory with E

### O: Particular Negative
"Some A's are not B's"
- Contradictory with A

# Carroll Diagram
Each category we are talking about corresponds to a class of individuals
- These Individuals belong a larger class, called the universe of discourse
	- Dentoed as $U$
- Write 0 if there is no such individual exists, and $x$ if there is some individuals that lies on that category


**Ex)** 
A: All foxes are dogs
- This is the same thing as saying that there aren't any foxes are non-dogs

E: No Frog are warm-blooded
- There aren't any warm-blooded frogs
![[Pasted image 20241106131211.png|200]]

I: Some Bacteria are Parasite
- There is at least one individual that is a bacterium and a parasite

O:

## Validity with Carroll Diagram
If an argument is valid, then denial of the conclusoin will be incompatible with the truth of the premises
- If we have entered the premises on the diagram, then the denial of the conclusion will be incompatible with what we have already entered
- Or the conclusion will be entailed by the information that we have entered

Rule of Thumb)
- Draw A,E Statement first

**Ex)**
No I are B
Some S are I
Therefore, Some B are not S

Carroll Diagram based on the premises
![[Pasted image 20241118124344.png|200]]
- by Square 1, there is some B that are not S
- Therefore, the argument is valid

**Ex)**
No I are B
Some S are I
Therefore, No S are B

Carroll Diagram based on the premises
![[Pasted image 20241118124344.png|200]]
- So prove the conclusion, we need 5 to be 0 as well, but we don't know this
- Therefore, the argument is invalid
# Conversion
Switching the subject and predicate
- A statement is validly convertible iff it is logically equivalent with to its converse
	- A and O statements are not validly convertible
	- E and I statements are convertible

# Universal Quantification $\forall \text{ }$
**A Statement**
All $M$ are $N$
$\to \forall_{x} \text{ }(M_{x}\to N_{x})$
$\to$ $\forall \text{ }x$, if $x$ is an M, then $x$ is an N

**Ex)**
All dodos are extinct
- D: $x$ is a dodo
- E: $x$ is extinct
$\to \forall_{x} \text{ }(D_{x}\to E_{x})$

**E Statement**
No M are N
$\to \forall_{x} \text{ }(M_{x}\to \neg N_{x})$
$\to$ For all $x$, if $x$ is an M, then it is not the case that $x$ is an $N$

## "Only" Claim
"Only M are S" is equivalent to "All S are M"

**Ex)**
Nobody but a MISER would SAVE egg shells
- $\forall_{x} \text{ }(S_{x}\to M_{x})$

Nothing but GOLD will SILENCE him
- $\forall_{x} \text{ }(S_{x}\to G_{x})$

## Symbolizing Singular Terms and Names
$$\text{(Predicate)}_{\text{(subject)}}$$
We will symbolize these by using lower case letters
- Except for $x,y,z$ which we reserve for variables

**Ex)**
Steve Sharkey is a MERCENARY
- $M_{s}$

Amoss Judd LOVES cold mutton
- $L_{j}$

This dish is a PUDDING
- $P_{d}$

### In Carroll Diagram
We put the lower case initials of subject in the corresponding square in Carroll Diagram

**Ex)**
Amoss Judd LOVES cold mutton
- $L_{j}$

## Inference Rules for Universal Quantifiers
### Universal Instantiation(UI)
From a universal quantification, infer any instance of it
- From $\forall_{x} \text{ }\phi_{x}$, where $\phi_{x}$ is some predicate, we can drive $\phi_{n}$ where $n$ denotes an individual name
	- If $n$ falls on the domain
	$\forall_{x} \text{ }P_{x}$
	$P_{n}$

**Ex)**
1. $\forall_{x} \text{ }(B_{x}\to M_{x})$   prem
2. $B_{s}$                      prem 
3. $B_{s}\to M_{s}$           1 UI
4. $M_{s}$                     2,3 MP

**Ex)**
$\forall_{x} \text{ }(P_{x}\to M_{x}), \forall_{x} \text{ }(M_{x}\to \neg A_{x})\text{ }\therefore P_{g}\to \neg A_{g}$
1. $\forall_{x} \text{ }(P_{x}\to M_{x})$     prem
2. $\forall_{x} \text{ }(M_{x}\to \neg A_{x})$  prem
3. $P_{g}\to M_{g}$             1 UI
4. $M_{g}\to \neg A_{g}$          1 UI
5. $P_{g}\to \neg A_{g}$           3,4 HS

### Universal Generalization(UG)
Infer a Universal Quantification from a suitably **arbitrary instance** of it
- We will use $u, v, w$ for arbitrary individuals
- From $\phi_{u}$, derive, $\forall_{x} \text{ }\phi_{x}$
	$P_{u}$
	$\forall_{x} \text{ }P_{x}$

**Ex)**
$G: \forall_{x} \text{ }(M_{x}\to I_{x})$
1. $\forall_{x} \text{ }(M_{x}\to F_{x})$   prem
2. $\forall_{x} \text{ }(F_{x}\to I_{x})$     prem
3. $M_{u}\to F_{u}$          1 UI
4. $F_{u}\to I_{u}$            1 UI
5. $M_{u}\to I_{u}$           3,4 HS
6. $\forall_{x} \text{ }(M_{x}\to I_{x})$   5 UG

# Existential Quantification $\exists \text{ }$
**I Statement**
Some P are Q
- $\exists_{x} \text{ }(P_{x}\text{ \& }Q_{x} )$
- There is at least one $x$ such that $x$ is P and $x$ is Q

**O Statement**
Some P are not Q
- $\exists_{x} \text{ }(P_{x}\text{ \& }\neg Q_{x})$
- There is at least $x$ such that $x$ is P and $x$ is not Q

## Inference Rule
### Existential Instantiation (EI)
From Existential Quantification infer suitably **arbitrary instance**
- Use $i,j,k$ for arbitrary instance
	$\exists_{x} \text{ }P_{x}$
	$P_{i}$
