# Syllogism
Arguments that consist of two premises and a conclusion
- Each of the statements is a categorical statement
- A statement that asserts a connection between two categories, a subject and a predicate
	- "All (subject) are (predicate)"

**Ex)**
1. All animals of the dog family are carnivore
2. Foxes are animals belonging to the dog family
3. Therefore, foxes are carnivores

All D are C
All F are D
$\therefore$ All F are C

## A, E, I, O Statements
Four types of statements, two of which affirm some relationship between categories and two which deny
- A, I: Affirm
- E, O: Deny

### A: Universal Affirmative
"All A's are B's"
- Contradictory with O

### E: Universal Negative
"No A's are B's"
- Contraictory with I

### I: Particular Affirmative
"Some A's are B's"
- Contradictory with E

### O: Particular Negative
"Some A's are not B's"
- Contradictory with A

# Carroll Diagram
Each category we are talking about corresponds to a class of individuals
- These Individuals belong a larger class, called the universe of discourse
	- Dentoed as $U$
- Write 0 if there is no such individual exists, and $x$ if there is some individuals that lies on that category


**Ex)** 

A: All foxes are dogs
- This is the same thing as saying that there aren't any foxes are non-dogs

# Conversion
Switching the subject and predicate
- A statement is validly convertible iff it is logically equivalent with to its converse
	- A and O statements are not validly convertible
	- E and I statements are convertible
