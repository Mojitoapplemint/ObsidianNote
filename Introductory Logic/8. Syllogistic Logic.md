# Syllogism
Arguments that consist of two premises and a conclusion
- Each of the statements is a categorical statement
- A statement that asserts a connection between two categories, a subject and a predicate
	- "All (subject) are (predicate)"

**Ex)**
1. All animals of the dog family are carnivore
2. Foxes are animals belonging to the dog family
3. Therefore, foxes are carnivores

All D are C
All F are D
$\therefore$ All F are C

## A, E, I, O Statements
Four types of statements, two of which affirm some relationship between categories and two which deny
- A, I: Affirm
- E, O: Deny

### A: Universal Affirmative
"All A's are B's"
- Contradictory with O

### E: Universal Negative
"No A's are B's"
- Contraictory with I

### I: Particular Affirmative
"Some A's are B's"
- Contradictory with E

### O: Particular Negative
"Some A's are not B's"
- Contradictory with A

# Carroll Diagram
Each category we are talking about corresponds to a class of individuals
- These Individuals belong a larger class, called the universe of discourse
	- Dentoed as $U$
- Write 0 if there is no such individual exists, and $x$ if there is some individuals that lies on that category


**Ex)** 
A: All foxes are dogs
- This is the same thing as saying that there aren't any foxes are non-dogs

E: No Frog are warm-blooded
- There aren't any warm-blooded frogs

I: Some Bacteria are Parasite
- There is at least one individual that is a bacterium and a parasite

O:

## Validity with Carroll Diagram
If an argument is valid, then denial of the conclusoin will be incompatible with the truth of the premises
- If we have entered the premises on the diagram, then the denial of the conclusion will be incompatible with what we have already entered
- Or the conclusion will be entailed by the information that we have entered

Rule of Thumb)
- Draw A,E Statement first

Ex)
No I are B
Some S are I
Therefore, Some B are not S

Carroll Diagram based on the premises
![[Pasted image 20241118124344.png|200]]
- by Square 1, there is some B that are not S
- Therefore, the argument is valid

# Conversion
Switching the subject and predicate
- A statement is validly convertible iff it is logically equivalent with to its converse
	- A and O statements are not validly convertible
	- E and I statements are convertible
