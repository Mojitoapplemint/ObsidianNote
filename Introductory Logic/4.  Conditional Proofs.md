# Unless
$$\neg p\to q$$
Unless you wear a jacket, you will catch a cold
- If you don't wear a jacket, you will catch a cold
- Either you will wear a jacket or you will catch a cold

Logically Equivalent to
$$p\lor q$$

# Otherwise & Else
Otherwise and else can be treated as logically equivalent

Not $M$. For else(or otherwise) T
- Not $M$. For if $M$ then $T$, but not $T$
	- $M\to T, \neg T \therefore \neg M$ (MT)
- Not $M$. For either not $M$ or $T$, but not $T$
	- $\neg M \lor T, \neg T \therefore \neg M$ (DS)
- Therefore, $M \to T$ and $\neg M\lor T$ are logically equivalent

$p$ otherwise $q$ can be symbolized either by
- $\neg p\to q, \neg q \therefore p$
- $p\lor q, \neg q \therefore p$

# Proving Conditional with Supposition
Prove if $p\lor q$, then $\neg p\to q$

Suppose $\neg p$, assuming $p\lor q$ is true, we can then infer $q$ by DS, so if $\neg q$ is true, $q$ is too
- Thus, if $\neg p$ then $q$

## Step
Suppose antecedent as a statement as a indented line
- Derive the consequent and infer the conditional
- Then, we have to discharge the supposition
	- We can't utilize Indented stuff once we dischage the conditional

$1. p\lor w$
  | $2. \neg q$         supp/CP
  | $3. w$           1,2 DS 
$4. \neg p \to w$       2-3 CP

# Only If
$p$ if $q$
- If $q$, then $p$
- $q\to p$

$p$ only if $q$
- If $p$, then $q$
- $p\to q$

# Necessary/Sufficient Condition 
If $p$, then $q$
- Necessary conditions are consequent
	- $p$ is necessary condition for $q$
- Sufficient conditions are antecedents

# Biconditional Equivalence(BE)
$$p\leftrightarrow q$$
is logically equivalent to 
$$(p\to q)\&(q\to p)$$
