An argument involving disjunction, which shows that each of the two disjuncts leads to a certain conclusion, often an undesired or surprising one

# Dilemma Inference Rule
The initial disjunction is often left implicit in dilemmas
- Conclusion is so ovbious that often become implicit
$$q\lor p, p\to r, q \to r \therefore r$$

We can prove $(p\lor q)\to r$ using contrapositive
- $\neg r \to \neg(p\lor q)$
