# Terminology
Argument
- An attempt to **convince you of the truth of one claim** by *providing other claims* as evidence

Conclusion
- The ultimate aim of the argument

Premises
- Claims that the argument uses as evidence

Inference
- Transition that one makes between the premises and conclusion

Statement
- Arguments that expresses something true or false
	- Can't be built out of just any type of sentence
- Not questions or commands
- Proposition: What does the statement express
	- We want to distinguish proposition and statement itself because two different statements can express the same proposition

## Inference Indicator
- All arguments have inferences and if there is a set of claims that involve an inference, they are an argument
- A set of claims involves an inference iff the set of claims is an argument

**Ex)**
Therefore(conclusion), Which means that, Because(premises)
