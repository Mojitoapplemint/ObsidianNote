# Terminology
Argument
- An attempt to **convince you of the truth of one claim** by *providing other claims* as evidence

Conclusion
- The ultimate aim of the argument

Premises
- Claims that the argument uses as evidence

Inference
- Transition that one makes between the premises and conclusion

Statement
- Arguments that expresses something true or false
	- Can't be built out of just any type of sentence
- Not questions or commands
- Proposition: What does the statement express
	- We want to distinguish proposition and statement itself because two different statements can express the same proposition

## Inference Indicator
- All arguments have inferences and if there is a set of claims that involve an inference, they are an argument
- A set of claims involves an inference iff the set of claims is an argument

**Ex)**
Therefore(conclusion), Which means that, Because(premises)

# Type of Argument
## Implicit Argument
Arguments that doesn't contain any inference indicator

**Enthymemes)**
Arguments with missing Premises or Conclusions

## Simple Argument
Arguments that has only one premise and conclusion

# Diagramming Argument
Connect premises and conclusions with down arrow Premises at the top, conclusion at the bottom
  (Premises)
    $\downarrow$
  (Conclusion)

**Ex)**
(1) Drug use is wrong **because** (2) it is immoral, and it is immoral **because** (3) it enslaves the mind and destroys the soul
  (3)
   $\downarrow$
  (2) $\to$ Subconclusion
   $\downarrow$
  (1)

## Independent Premises
If we remove one premises, other premises still support the conclusion
- Two premises are independent to each other

**Ex)**

## Dependent Premises
Both premises do not support each other but the statement require both to support the conclusion

**Ex)**
Different cultures have different moral codes. But if ethics were objective then all cultures would agree about what's right or wrong. This goes to show that ethics aren't objective.
