# Terminology
Argument
- An attempt to **convince you of the truth of one claim** by *providing other claims* as evidence

Conclusion
- The ultimate aim of the argument

Premises
- Claims that the argument uses as evidence

Inference
- Transition that one makes between the premises and conclusion

Statement
- Arguments that expresses something true or false
	- Can't be built out of just any type of sentence
- Not questions or commands
- Proposition: What does the statement express
	- We want to distinguish proposition and statement itself because two different statements can express the same proposition

## Inference Indicator
- All arguments have inferences and if there is a set of claims that involve an inference, they are an argument
- A set of claims involves an inference iff the set of claims is an argument

**Ex)**
Therefore(conclusion), Which means that, Because(premises)

# Type of Argument
## Implicit Argument
Arguments that doesn't contain any inference indicator

**Enthymemes)**
Arguments with missing Premises or Conclusions

## Simple Argument
Arguments that has only one premise and conclusion

# Diagramming Argument
Connect premises and conclusions with down arrow Premises at the top, conclusion at the bottom
  (Premises)
    $\downarrow$
  (Conclusion)

**Ex)**
(1) Drug use is wrong **because** (2) it is immoral, and it is immoral **because** (3) it enslaves the mind and destroys the soul
  (3)
   $\downarrow$
  (2) $\to$ Subconclusion
   $\downarrow$
  (1)

## Independent Premises
If we remove one premises, other premises still support the conclusion
- Two premises are independent to each other

**Ex)** (1) Universities must expect further cuts **because** (2) they have suffered less than other sectors of education. But even if that were not so, (1) they should expect further cuts **because** (3) they are not sufficiently vocationally oriented.

## Dependent Premises
Both premises do not support each other but the statement require both to support the conclusion

**Ex)**
(2) Different cultures have different moral codes. But (3) if ethics were objective then all cultures would agree about what’s right and wrong. **This goes to show** (1) that ethics aren’t objective.

# Validity
1. All living things need water
2. Roses need water
3. Therefore, roses are living things
$\implies$ Bad(Invalid) Argument

An argument is **valid** iff it is not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false
- Truth of premises guarantee truth of conclusion

## Soundness
1. If she's made of wood, she's a witch
2. If she weighs the same as a duck, she's made of wood
3. Therefore, if she weighs the same as a duck, she's a witch
$\implies$ The argument is valid, but it is *not sound since the premises are false*

An argument is **sound** iff it is valid and all of its premises are true

## Deduction vs Induction
It is worth nothing that invalid arguments can still be good arguments
- Inductive Arguments
	- Ampliative: Conclusion is telling something new
- **Deductive Arguments**
	- Non-Ampliative: Conclusion is using the same information from premises
