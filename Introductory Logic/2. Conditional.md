Statement
- Sentence(or part of a sentence) that expresses something true or false
- Can be built out of more than one statement
	- Check whether the entire sentence is still a statement even if one part is removed
	- Ex) "Roses need water and roses are living things"

# Logical Operation
## And( $\wedge$ , &)
True if both p and q are true, unless it’s false or unknown (True & Unknown) 

## Or( $\lor$ )
True at least one of them are true.

“$p\text{ XOR } q$ / $p\oplus q$"
- Only true if one of them is true, not both

## Implication( $p\longrightarrow q$  / $p\implies q$)
“$\text{if }p\text{, then }q$" : ( $p\longrightarrow q$ )
“$p\text{ implies }q$” : ( $p\implies q$ )
- **True if whenever p is true, q is also true **
- To show an implication is false, find counter example(p is true, but q is false)
- *The only case it’s false if p is true, but q is false *

**Note)**
If $p$ is always false, then we take "$p\longrightarrow q$" to *be true*, regardless $q$ is true or false 
- If 0=1, then 1+1=5 : is considered as true 

## If and only if ( $p\longleftrightarrow q$ / $p\iff q$ / $p\text{ iff }q$)
- True if whenever p is true, q is true, and whenever q is true, then p is true 
- Original statement and its converse are both true 

## Not P ( $\lnot p$ )
true if p is false, and false if p is true
