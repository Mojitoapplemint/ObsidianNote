# Modus Ponens
$$\text{If A, then B , A  }\therefore B$$

We will represent this form itself in lower case letter
- $p\to q\text{ , } p \therefore q$

We can check whether other argument is valid by seeing if they have the same form
- An argument is suabstitution instance

## Affirming the Consequent
$$\text{If A, then B , B  }\therefore A$$
Not good argument

# Negation
$$\neg A$$
- It is not the case that...
- We can negate part of statement, or the entire statement as well
- Truth-Funcional: A statement and its negation contradicts each other

## Double Negation
$$\neg(\neg A)=A$$

# Modus Tollens
$$\text{If A, then B , }\neg \text{B}\therefore \neg \text{A}$$

# Denying the Antecedent
$$p\to q, \neg p\therefore \neg q$$

# Conjuction
$$A\text{ \& }B$$
- True if both $A$ and $B$ are true
- If at least one is false, then the entire statement is false
- Binary: Must joining two conjuncts

## Simplication(Simp)
$$p\text{ \& }q\implies p$$
$$p\text{ \& }q\implies q$$

## Conjuction(Conj)
$$p,q\implies p\text{ \& }q$$

## Conjunctive Syllogism(CS)
You are saying that at least one the conjuncts is false
- If one of them is true, then the other one must be false
$$\neg(P\&Q), P\text{ } \therefore \neg Q$$
# Disjunction
$$p \lor q$$
The entire statement is true if at least one of $p$ and $q$ is true

## Governing Operator
The operator that determines the truth function of the entire statement
- Truth value of the entire statement is dependent on the governing operators


## Disjunctive Syllogism(DS)
$$p\lor q, \neg p \therefore q$$

# Hypothetical Syllogism(HS)
$$A\to B, B\to C\therefore A\to C$$
