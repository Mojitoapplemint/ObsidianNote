# Modus Ponens
$$\text{If A, then B , A  }\therefore B$$

We will represent this form itself in lower case letter
- $p\to q\text{ , } p \therefore q$

We can check whether other argument is valid by seeing if they have the same form
- An argument is suabstitution instance

## Affirming the Consequent
$$\text{If A, then B , B  }\therefore A$$
Not good argument

# Negation
$$\neg A$$
- It is not the case that...
- We can negate part of statement, or the entire statement as well
- Truth-Funcional: A statement and its negation contradicts each other

## Double Negation
$$\neg(\neg A)=A$$

# Modus Tollens
$$\text{If A, then B , }\neg \text{B}\therefore \neg \text{A}$$
