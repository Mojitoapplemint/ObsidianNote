# Modus Ponens
$$\text{If A, then B , A  }\therefore B$$

We will represent this form itself in lower case letter
- $p\to q\text{ , } p \therefore q$

We can check whether other argument is valid by seeing if they have the same form
- An argument is suabstitution instance

## Affirming the Consequent
$$\text{If A, then B , B  }\therefore A$$
Not good argument

# Negation
$$\neg A$$
- It is not the case that...
- We can negate part of statement, or the entire statement as well
- Truth-Funcional: A statement and its negation contradicts each other

## Double Negation
$$\neg(\neg A)=A$$

# Modus Tollens
$$\text{If A, then B , }\neg \text{B}\therefore \neg \text{A}$$

# Denying the Antecedent
$$p\to q, \neg p\therefore \neg q$$

# Conjuction
$$A\text{ \& }B$$
- True if both $A$ and $B$ are true
- If at least one is false, then the entire statement is false
- Binary: Must joining two conjuncts

## Simplication(Simp)
$$p\text{ \& }q\implies p$$
$$p\text{ \& }q\implies q$$

## Conjuction(Conj)
$$p,q\implies p\text{ \& }q$$

## Conjunctive Syllogism(CS)
You are saying that at least one the conjuncts is false
- If one of them is true, then the other one must be false
$$\neg(P\&Q), P\text{ } \therefore \neg Q$$
# Disjunction
$$p \lor q$$
The entire statement is true if at least one of $p$ and $q$ is true

## Governing Operator
The operator that determines the truth function of the entire statement
- Truth value of the entire statement is dependent on the governing operators


## Disjunctive Syllogism(DS)
$$p\lor q, \neg p \therefore q$$

# Unless
$$\neg p\to q$$
Unless you wear a jacket, you will catch a cold
- If you don't wear a jacket, you will catch a cold
- Either you will wear a jacket or you will catch a cold

Logically Equivalent to
$$p\lor q$$

# Otherwise & Else
Otherwise and else can be treated as logically equivalent

Not $M$. For else(or otherwise) T
- Not $M$. For if $M$ then $T$, but not $T$
	- $M\to T, \neg T \therefore \neg M$ (MT)
- Not $M$. For either not $M$ or $T$, but not $T$
	- $\neg M \lor T, \neg T \therefore \neg M$ (DS)
- Therefore, $M \to T$ and $\neg M\lor T$ are logically equivalent

$p$ otherwise $q$ can be symbolized either by
- $\neg p\to q, \neg q \therefore p$
- $p\lor q, \neg q \therefore p$
