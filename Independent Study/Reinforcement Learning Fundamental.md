# Definition
Learning what to do -how to map situations to actions- so as *to maximize the numerical reward signal*
- **Trial-and-Error Search:** The learner is not told which actions to take, but discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them
- **Delayed Rewards:** Actions may affect not onlt the immediate rewards but also next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards

## Markov Decision Process
Learning agent must 
1) Be able to *sense the state of its environment* to some extent
2) Be able to *take actions* that affect the state
3) *Have a goal* or goals relating to the state of environment

Will discuss deeply in Chapter 3

## Unsupervised Learning
In interactive problems, it is often impractical to obtain examples of desired behaviour that are both correvt and representative of all the situations
