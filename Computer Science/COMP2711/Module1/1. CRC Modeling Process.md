# Structure of CRC Card
## Class name
- Collection of similar objects
- Use singular noun or phrase

## Responsibility
- Knowledge a class maintain, or a service class provides
- What the **class know, or does**
- After identified responsibility, ask what class it belongs to
- Use the "What/Who Cycle" to assign responsibilities to components
	1. Identify components during the process of imagining we have a working system
	2. Ask What activity needs to be performed next
	3. Decide who performed that action

## Collaborator
- Classes that **request for information or to do something** to certain class
- When a class need information that it doesn't have
- When a class needs to modify information that it doesn't have
- At least one initiator of any given collaboration
