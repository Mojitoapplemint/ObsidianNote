Go to [[ICA ATM#Sequence Diagram|ATM examples]]

Type of [[2. UML Indoctrination|UML diagram]] that shows how classes are interacting each other **in the order**
- Literally, they show the sequence of events

Objects and Actor
- Objects: Factors that actually involved in the sequence
	- Represented by rectangle
- Actor: Factors are external to the sequence; outside the scope of the system
	- Represented by stick figure

# Steps
1. Identifies all actors and objects and putting them in order how they interact each other
	- `Actors(Operator) -> [ATM] -> [Bank Server] -> [Bank Account]`
2. Draw a **lifeline**
	- Moving down on the lifeline means that time passes
3. Think about the actual process of the sequence and draw a message based on that

# Component of the Sequence Diagram

## Instances of classes or actors
- Shown as box with the class and object identifier underlined
- Actors are shown using the stick-person
- Box for object created later locates lower than others

## Message 
- Show the *information being sent* between objects
- Sequence diagram shows the order of the interaction by drawing messages by moving down on the lifeline
- **Return message** of the request of information is drawn by *dash line*
	- `Asking for verifying card and return that it is okay`

## Alternative frame
- A choice between two or more message sequence
	- `What if the PIN of the card is invalid, etc.`

- And then continue sequence from the bottom of the box

## Activation box
- Show when and how long an object is performing a process(computation)
	- Since actor is external to the sequence, they do not need activation box
