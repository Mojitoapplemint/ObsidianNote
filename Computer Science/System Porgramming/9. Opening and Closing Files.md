# `fopen`
- Opening file creates a *file pointer*
- `stdio.h` defines a `FILE *` data type
- `FILE *fptr = fopen(fname, "option")`
- `"Option"`
	- `"r"`: Reading
	- `"w"`: Writing
	- `"a"`: Appending
- `fclose` to close file
- `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr` are defined in `stdio.h`

## Reading and Writing
- Standard input/output methods have equivalents for other streams
- File pointers are required to indicate which stream to use
- Usually have a prefix **"f"**
	- `fprintf(fptr, fmt_str, ...)` will print formatted data to specified file
	- `getc` and `putc` are equivalent to `getchar` and `putchar`

## Rules of Thumb
- Check whether the `File *` is null pointer or not
- If we use `File *` in function, the function wouldn't change the value in the file after the function terminate. Thus, to actually update the file, we need to *pass pointer of file pointer*
