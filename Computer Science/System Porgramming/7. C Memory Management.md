# Memory Management
- C arrays are very rigid
	- Automatic size-changing arrays is not available in C
	- Making array as large as possible is not efficient
- We need to do memory management by ourselves

# Function
- Found in `stdlib.h`
- Allows
	1. Allocating memory
	2. Deallocating memory
	3. Reallocating memory: Changes size of an allocated block

## Memory Allocation
- Return pointer to newly-reserved block

`void *malloc(size_t size)`
- Allocates size bytes of memory
- Returns a pointer of type `void *`
	- Initial position of the memory
- Memory is *not initialized*

`void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size)`
- Allocates memory based on number of elements and element size
- *Initializes memory to zeros*

### `size_t` 
- A special **unsigned integer** type
- Result returned by the `sizeof` and `alignof` operators
- It can store the maximum size of a theoretically possible array or an object
	- Only allows non-negative integers 

### Example
```C
//Example 1: provide a single integer
int *intp = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
	//Ex) *intp = 2;

//Example 2: provide a sequence of 8 int tiles, like an array
int *intp = (int *) malloc(8*sizeof(int));
	//Ex) intp[2] = 4;
	//Ex) *(intp+2) = 4;

//Example 3: provide a sequence of 16 char tiles, which can be used as a buffer to store a stiring up to 15 chanracter in length (and a NUL character)
char *s = (char *) malloc(16);
	//Ex) s[15] = '\0';
	//Ex) strcpy(s, "Hello");
```

## Deallocation
- Frees up unneeded memory

`void free(void *ptr)`
- Allows re-use of memory
- `ptr` must be pointing the allocated memory
	- Freed memory must not be accessed again
	- Failure to free memory after use cause `memory leak` bug

## Reallocation
- Used to change the memory assigned to a block
	- Usually getting doubled
- Returns a pointer to the resized block which may have been moved
- Doesn't changing existing data less up to size
- Used when we can't predict the size in advance
- **It is safe to assign the return value at temporary pointer, check whether it is null or not, and reassign to the original pointer only if it's not null**

`void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)`
- If `ptr` is null, equivalent to `malloc`
	- If `ptr` is not null, it must have been allocated previously and not freed
- If `size` is 0, equivalent to `free`
