# Libraries
- Fundamental C syntax is very basic, thus lacks some important features
	- I/O
	- File management
	- Math (beyond arithmetic)
- These features and others are provided by standard libraries
- Programmers can write new libraries with new functions
- Can contain almost anything we want to have in our pragram
	- Function definitions
	- Variable definitions
	- Type definitions
	- Preprocessor directives
- Allows sharing of development effort between programs
- Centralizes code to make maintenance easier

# Scope
- Scope of a variable/function is the block or the region in the program where a *variable/function is declared, defined, and used(accessible)*
- Can accomplish connections between programs and libraries, implementation hidings, etc

## Declaration vs Definition
- Declaring a variable provide a description
- Definition a variable allocates storage
- We can declare a variable without defining is using the `extern` keyword

## Automatic vs External
- Automatic variables are defined inside function, automatically created and deleted with function call
	- Since nested function is not allowed in C, all automatic variables are in exactly one function
	- can also be declared inside blocks
	- Are in scope in the function or block where they are declared
- External variables are defined outside of any function
	- Are in scope until the end of the file which they're declared

## Static External Variable
- By default, external variables are available to any other source file that uses the appropriate `extern` declaration
- `static` keywords creates private external variable
	- Not accessible to other file
	- Provides implementation hiding 

## Static Internal Variable
- Automatic variable do not persist across function call
- `static` keyword make variable shared across calls of function

## Scope of Functions
- Function declarations allow access to functions defined in other files
- Declarations can also allow us to use functions earlier in the source code than their definition


# Brief Preview of Compilation
- Three main steps
	- Preprocessing
	- Compilation proper
	- Linking
- `Preprocessor`: Prepares human-friendly source code for compilation
- `Compilation`: Produces machine language code for each component of the program
- `Linking`: Assembles the code for each compoment to produce a complete program

## Preprocessor Directives
Indicated by a `#` prefix
- `#include`: Includes the contents of a file in the current source code file
- `#define`: Defines a macro(usually a constant)
- `#undef`: Defines a macro(usually a constant)

Conditionals: used to implement conditional compilation
- `#if, #ifdef, #ifndef`
- `#elif`
- `#else`
- `#endif`


## Header Files
- Contain function, variable and macro declaration
- Used to define the interface to the library
- Ensures that the definitions are in proper scope
- Does not contain executable code, just definition
	- Perhaps except initialization
- Use `.h` extension

# Library Implementation
- Actual executable code for library functions
- `.c` extension
- Must be compiled
	- Once compiled, it will be linked to the main program
