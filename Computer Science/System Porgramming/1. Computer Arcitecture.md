# Von Neumann Architecture

![[Pasted image 20240109093545.png|400]]
Four main Components
- Processing Unit
- Memory Unit
- Input Devices
- Output Devices

## Input Devices
- How outside data or instructions **get into** the computer
- Ex) Keyboard, mouse, network interface, etc

## Output Device
- How the result of the computation are **communicated to or affect the outside world**
	- Ex) Monitor, network interface, projectors, motors...

## Memory Unit
- Memory here represents all information storage
- Everything from registers to tape drives
- Stores both data and instruction

## Central Processing Unit
- The part of the computer that acts
- Executes instructions read from memory
- Performs specified operations on data read from memory

## Performance
- Processing costs
	- Instructions per second(MIPS)
	- Floating-point operations per second(GFLOPS)
- Communication costs
	- CPU with input, output, memory


# Two-State Machines
## Data Representation
- Data is represented using a basic element with two distinct states
- Interpretation of the state is arbitrary
	- Physical interpretation
		- Voltage, Current, Presence ot absence of a hole in the punch card
	- True/False
	- 1/0
	- On/Off

## Units of Data
- Bit
	- The elementary unit of information, with two distinct states
- Byte
	- A group of 8 bits; usually the smallest data type available to programming languages
- Word
	- A group of bytes, with a system-dependent size
	- 32-bit system has 4-byte word
- Larger quantities of data are often groups as powers of 2, in bytes
- Causes confusion with SI prefixes: $2^{10}= 1024 \approx 1000$
	- Use special binary prefixes
	- $1KB = 1024$ bytes
	- $1kB = 1000$ bytes
	- $1MiB = 1024^2$ bytes
	- $1MB = 1000^2$ bytes
## Data Interpretation
- Interpretation of a sequence of bits is also arbitrary
- The same sequence of bits might represent
	- One or more letters
	- Numbers
	- A CPU instruction
	- Any other type of data

# Memory Hierarchy

Fast memory is too expensive to be large, slow memory can be cheap and enormous

In order from fastest and smallest to slowest and largest
1. Register: 
	- Internal working memory in CPU; dozens of bytes
	- Value is actually operating here

2. CPU cache: 
	- High-speed memory on the CPU die; millions of bytes

3. Ram: 
	- Main memory used during operation; billions of bytes

4. HDD/SSD: Primarily **non-volatile** storage
	- **Non-volatile storage:** Power is not necessary to maintain the system
	- SSD: hundreds of billions of bytes
	- HDD: hundreds of trillions of bytes

- Placing a right data in the right places is the key to good performance
	- Poor placement of data can make a system unusable
- Managed by programs and the OS

# Software Layers
![[Pasted image 20240111090838.png|200]]
## Application Software
- Used directly by human
- Accomplishes specific high-level tasks
	- Games
	- Office suites
	- Graphics editors

## System Software
- Provides specialized service to other programs
	- Database
	- Compliers and debugging tools
	- Search tools

## Operating System
- Interfaces between higher-level programs and hardware
- Coordinates multiple programs
- Provides "essential" services to programs

### Kernel
- Core of the operating system
- Theoretically, only part that interacts directly with hardware

### Service Layer
- Translates request from the command layer into detailed instruction for kernel
	- 1/0 access
	- File manipulation
	- Network interface access

### Command Layer
- The shell
- Only parts of OS that directly interacts with user

# Common Data Type
## Characters
- Which sequence of bits corresponds to a given character depends on the encoding used
- ASCII uses 7 bits of a byte
- Unicode can represent many different writing systems in the same encoding
- Bit sequences are often represented as integers when describing the encoding 
- Alphabetical order usually corresponds to numerical order

## Integers
- Positive
	- Represented as base-2 numbers
- Negative
	- Represented using two complement notation
- Two complement representation allows the same procedure to add negatives and positive numbers
## Floating-point Numbers
- Non-integer numbers
- Fixed point representation
	- Decimal point at a fixed position
	- Limited range
- Floating point representation
	- Based on scientific notation
	- Separate fixed point mantissa and integer exponent
	- Includes special value: infinity, "Not a number"
- Size of the data does matter
	- If numbers are extremely different, the ordering add does matter
		- Called Underflow
	- If we add small number in extremely large number, it wouldn't make change
## CPU instruction
- Bit string is broken down into arbitrary fields
- Must encode operation and arguments
- Not normally manipulated by programs, except compliers
