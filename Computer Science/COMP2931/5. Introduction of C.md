# Basic Information
- Compiled Language
	- Must be translated into machine language
- Native Language of Unix-based systems
	- Development closely tied to Unix
- Provides very low-level access to hardware
- Relatively simple syntax and semantics, but a powerful general-purpose language

# `#include
- Preprocessor is directed by `#`
- Header file is in the location of the standard libraries (angle brackets)
	- `stdio.h`
	- `math.h`
		- Trig functions
		- Exponential, logarithm
		- Power(`pow(x,y)`), sqrt
		- Rounding: `ceil(x), floor(x)`

# Main
`main() {...}`
- No arguments
- No return type given
	- `return 0` is default

# Variable
- Must be declared before use
- Require placeholder(%) for each variable
	- char: %c
	- int: %d
	- long: %ld
	- short: %d
	- float: %f
	- double: %lf

# Arithmetic Operation
Additional functions are available from `math.h`

Most mathematic operators and logic is same with java
- `++x`: Adds 1 to $x$ and returns the *new* value
- `x++`: Adds 1 to $x$ and returns the *old* value

Division
- `(int)/(int)` gives integer by round down
	- Do `1.0/3.0` instead of `1/3` to get floating point

There is no `boolean` type: *use 0 as false, non-zero is true*

# Function
`"return type" "name"(parameter){Body}`
- Need to have corresponding return value 

```C
int power(int x, int y){
	int i; // <- May have to initialize before 'for' loop
	int result = 1;
	for(i=1;i<=y;i++){
		result *=x;
	}
	return result;
}
```
- `int i`: before `c89`, we had to initialize before the actual for loop
	- After `c99`, we can do exactly same with java
- Return value only works with one value

# Memory
- [[1. Computer Arcitecture#Von Neumann Architecture|Von Neumann architecture]] means a single memory hierarchy for instructions and data
- How is the memory organized?
	1. Consider memory divided into cells
	2. Each cell is one byte
	3. Each cell has a numerical address
	4. Memory addresses can be stored and manipulated like any other numbers
- Stored memory addresses are called **pointer**

# Pointers
## Syntax and Semantics
- `&x` represents the address of variable `x` in memory
- Let `p = &x`, then `p` is now pointer to `x`
	- `p` is also a variable
- Can access to `x` from `p`: `*p` (dereferencing)
- Pointer is not a sufficient type for a variable
	- Is valid pointer `*p` a integer? or float?
- Defining pointer requires specification
	- Pointer to Integer: `int *p`
	- Pointer to float: `float *p`
- Type of pointer only matters when dereferencing
- A "bare" memory address can be stored in a `void *` pointer
	- It can't be dereferenced

## Example
```C
main(){
    int x = 1;
    int *p = &x;
    
    //-----------------
    int *p2 = &*p;
    //or 
    int **p2=&p
    //-----------------
    
    printf("%d %d\n", *p, *p2);
}
-> both p and p2 have access to x
```

# One-way Pointers are Dangerous
## Uninitialized Pointers
- Pointer points somewhere, but nowhere specific
- Trying to dereference this will cause a segmentation fault
- *Pointers must be initialized with a valid address before use*

## Null Pointers
- Special value set aside as the *invalid pointer* address
- `void *p = NULL`
	- May or may not be 0
	- Semantically, `NULL` is not 0 
- Dereferencing it produces segmentation fault
- Its usage: whenever we don't have a valid target for a pointer, we can set it to null; whenever we need to dereference a pointer, we can check if it's null

# Pointer Arithmetic
- We can add to and subtract from pointer

# Array
- Basic functionality is the same with java
	- It doesn't store size information
- `array` is the address of the first block 
	- Thus `array` is a pointer
- `array[0] = *array`
- `array[i] = *(array+i)`

## Strings
- Strings are array of characters
- Terminated by a null character `'\0'`
- We can create String by `char str[] = "Hello World"`
- Library `string.h` contains lots of processing functions
