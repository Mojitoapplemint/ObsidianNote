Text Pattern Matching
- Necessary to work with all filenames matching a pattern, not just a single exact name
- Also important to find text matching a pattern
	- Numbers
	- Address
- Two important method
	- Globbing
	- Regular Expressions

# Globbing
- Used in Command-line file expansion
- Easy to read/write
- Limited capabilities

| Operator    | Purpose    | Example |
| --- | --- | -------- |
| ?    | Any single character    |          |
| *    | Any string    |          |
| []   | Any character in set    |          |
| {}    | Any string in set    |          |

# Regular Expressions

Way of defining a structured match for a text value, in a way that it can be programmatically defined and time flexibly match a set of valid token
- General purpose pattern matching(for text)
- Available in many languages and environments
- Very sophisticated capabilities
- Complicated expressions aren't user-friendly

## Anchors
- `^`: The beginning of the line
- `$`: End of the line
### Examples
- `"note"`: Matches the word “note” anywhere on a line
- `"^note"`: Matches the word “note” only if it occurs at the beginning of a line
- `"\."$`: Matches a period if at the end of a line 
	- Since period is a special character, so therefore the escape is necessary

## Matching Operators
- `.`: Any single character, except line break
- `[...]`: Any character in this set
	- Ranges are allow by using `-` and ASCII code
	- `^` for "Not in this set" at the beginning 
- `{...}`: Any String in this set

### Examples
- `“ab.de"`: matches “ab” (and then any single character at all) and then “de"
	- “abcde”, “abAde”, “abZde”, “ab.de”, “ab:de”, etc. 
- `“ab[ABC]de”`
	- “abAde”, “abBde” or “abCde"
	- NOT “abade”, “abDde” etc.
- `"[0-9]”` – would match any single digit
- `“[a-zA-Z]”` – would match any single letter

## Repeat Operators
- Apply to the immediately preceding item(letter or set)
	- `*`: expresses the idea “must match zero or more times”
	- `+`: expresses the idea “must match one or more times”
	- `?`: expresses the idea “must match zero or one times”


| Operator | Purpose                                              | Example    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| []       | Any character in set                                 | \[abc\]    |
| [^]      | Any character *not* in set                           | \[^abc\]   |
| {}       | Any String in set                                    | {txt,doc}  |
| .        | Any single character except linkbreak                | file.      |
| \        | Remove special meaning from operator for literal use | `\$ = "$"` |
Repetition and Grouping

| Operator | Purpose | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| () | Grouping | (abc)* |
| ? | Zero-or-one multiplier | a?bc |
| + | One-or-more multiplier | \[aA\]+bc |
| * | Zero-or-more multiplier | \[aA\]* bc |
| {`int`} | `int` or more multiplier(-E) | [a-f]{4} |
| \``int` | Take the `(int)`^th grouping | (...)\1 |
