- Interactions with the shell can be automated
- Simple way to automate common actions
	- Program testing
	- Compiling programs
	- System administration
	- Running programs on collections of files
- Often faster and easier to write than a program for each task
- Requires good support from the design of the shell

Well Behaved Shells
- Standard way to specify commands without human interaction
	- Command Line Argument
	- Environment Variable
- Standard method for handling files, input, output
	- File system, file format
	- Unix systems treat everything as a file
	- Sophisticated file manipulation commands
	- Data flow
- Standard method for indicating success or failure
	- Need to determine if a command succeeded before trying the next one
	- Exit status byte(0 indicates success)

Simplest Bash Scripts
- Every command we type look like  single line bash script
	- Simplest of "Real" bash scripts a list of commands saved in the text
- Use file extention `.sh` for scripts
- Useful to have the first line define the shell to use
	- `#!/bin/bash`
- `#` is treated as comment
	- Above comment tells the OS wat kind of script this is

Executable Text Script
- Start the file with `#!` to include interpreter
- To make a text file executable, use coimmand `chmod`
	- separate permissions for users(u), group(g), and others(0)
	- Separate read(r), write(w), remove with -

# Variable
Bash Variable
- ANIMAL=cat
- ANIMALS="cat dog bird"
	- White space matter don't press space in between
	- Quotes are not necessary(but usually use "" or '')
- Untyped: Stored as strings, but interpreted differently 
- If it has the right separator, then is a list

- `$?`: Exist status of previous foreground command
- `$-`: Flag arguments

## Arrays
- `array[index]=value`: Assigning one value
- `array=(value1 value2 ...)`Assigning whole array
- `${array[index]}$`: Access element

# if
```bash
if
	[ "$i" -eq "$j" ]
then
	echo "Variables are equal"
else 
	echo "Variables are not equal"
fi
```
## Conditions

# Standard Input & Standard Output
By default, in bash..
- *Read data* from standard Input,
	- Keyboard input to the terminal
- *Print "normal" output* to standard output
	- Standard output is printed to the terminal
- *Prints error message* to standard error
	- standard error is also printed to the terminal

- These channels are not just for bash but everything can use them
	- Source and destination of channels can be changed

## Pipes
- Directs standard output of one command to the standard input of the next
- Represented by "|"
	- `cat jabber.txt jabber.txt | wc -l`
	- `wc`: word count
	- `-l`: number of line
- Chains of commands with no intermidiate files

## Redirection
- Use "<,>" to specify the direction
- `command < file`: Sends the contents of file to standard input of command
- `command > file`: Sends the standard output of command to file
	- Overrides if it's not empty
	- `command >> file`: Append standard output
- `command <<< ${variable}`: Sends contents of the variable to the command
	- Not always portable

### Iteration
## For
```Shell
for item in list
do
	(loop body)
done
```
- Useful when iterating over list
## While
```Shell
while [condition]
do
	(loop body)
done
/
while true -> Work just like java
```
## Until
```Shell
until [condition]
do
	(loop body)
done
```
## Break/Continue
```Shell
...
do
	...
	break/continue
	...
done
```
- `break`: To leave a loop
- `continue`: Skip rest of loop body and start a new iteration

# Bash Script
- Making scripts behave like any other command is available
- Command line arguments can be passed in the script
- The way access arguments in the script
	- `$#`: Number of arguments
	- `$@`: List of all arguments
	- `$0`: Name of the script
	- `$1`: First argument
	- `$2`: Second argument
	- `$n`: nth argument
	- `shift (integer)`: Remove assigned number of argument from the beginning. 
		- `default = 1`

## Sample Code
``` Shell
min_val=$2
max_val=$2

if [ $1 == "+" ]
then
	op_name="sum"
	result=0
elif [ $1 == "x" ]
then
	op_name="product"
	result=1
else
	echo "Error: $0 requires an operator as its first argument"
	exit 1
fi

shift  

for arg in $@
do
	if [ $op_name == "sum"]
	then
		result=$(($result+$arg))
	elif [ $op_name == "product" ]
	then	
		result=$(($result*$arg))
	fi

	if [ $arg -gt max_val ]
	then
		max_val=$arg
	elif [ $arg -lt min_val ]
	then
		min_val=$arg
	fi
done
echo "$# values with a minimum of $min_val, maximum of $max_val, and a $op_name of $result"

<Result>
./argtest.sh x 1 2 3 4 5 6
 -> 6 values with a minimum of 1, maximum of 6 and a product of 720
```

# Chaining Together Command
- `;` to replace newlines
- If we want to run a command iff the previous command succeeded:
	- `command1 && command2 && ...` 
	- Each command runs only iff the exist code of the previous command was 0(true)
- If we want to run a command iff the previous command failed
	- `command1 || command2 ||...` 
	- Each command runs only iff the exist code of the previous command was nonzero(false)

# IFS
