# Integer Arithmetic
## Addition
Usual addition but with binary

Overflow if result out of range
- $(+)+(-)$ : No overflow
- $(+)+(+)$ : Overflow if result sign is 1
- $(-)+(-)$ : Overflow if result sign is 0

## Subtraction
Add negation of second operand

Overflow if result out of range
- $(+)-(+)$ / $(-)-(-)$ : No overflow
- $(-)-(+)$ : Overflow if result sign is 0
- $(+)-(-)$ : Overflow if result sign is 1

## Signed Multiplication

Steps
1. Express numbers into 2's complement form
2. Using the same multiplication algorithm
	- For intermediate multiplication, we extend the sign bit
	- If multiplicand and multiplier is $n$-bits, then we extend until $2n$-bits
3. After adding all intermediate multiplication, we look at $2n$-bits from right
	- Ignore rest

## Division

Use the same algorithm
- But write 0 if we cannot substract

# Floating Point
## Scientific Notation
Notation where there is a single digit to the left of the decimal point

Normalized Number
- A number in scientific notation that has no leading 0s
- e.g. $1.0_{\text{ten}}\times10^{-9}$

## Scientific Notation in Binary
$$1.x x x x x x x _{\text{two}}\times{2}^{ y y y y}$$
- Typically, we express exponent in decimal for simplicity even though computer represents in binary

# Floating Point Representation
IEEE Floating Point format
$$(-1)^{\text{(sign bit)}}\times(1+\text{fraction})\times2^{\text{(exponent-Bias)}}$$

## Single-Precision Range
![[Pasted image 20250222174642.png]]
Representation in 32 bits word
- 8 bits for exponent
- Bias = 127
- *float* in C

Range
- Binary : $\pm 1.0\times 2^{-126}\sim \pm 2.0 \times 2^{127}$
- Decimal : $\pm 1.2\times 10^{-38} \sim \pm 3.4\times 10^{38}$

## Double-Precision
![[Pasted image 20250222175349.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250222175317.png]]
Representation in 64 bits double words
- 11 bits for exponent
- Bias = 1023
- *double* in C
- 6 decimal digits of precision

Range
- Binary : $\pm 1.0\times 2^{-1022}\sim \pm 2.0 \times 2^{1023}$
- Decimal : $\pm 2.2\times 10^{-308} \sim \pm 1.8\times 10^{308}$

## Overflow and Underflow in floating point
Overflow
- A situation in which a positive exopnent becomes too large to fit in the exponene field

Underflow
- Non zero fraction has become so small that it cannot be represented
- A situation in which a negative exopnent becomes too large to fit in the exponene field

If either happens, computer raise an exception
- Unscheduled event that disrupts program execution
	- Computer saves the address of cause, jumps to predefined address for exception routine
- Interrupt : Exceptions comes from outside of the processor
	- Somtime used interchangeably with exception

## Example) Express -0.75 in binary
Sign bit = 1
Integral part = $0_{\text{ten}}$
