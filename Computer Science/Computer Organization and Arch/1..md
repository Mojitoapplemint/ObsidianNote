# Hardware, Software, Performance and Power
- Both Hardware and Software affect performance and power efficiency
- Algorithm determines number of high-level language statements
- Language, compiler, and architecture determines the number of machine-level instructions required for the program
- Processor and memory implementation determines how fast and how much power is used to execute machine-level instructions

# Pervasive Computing
