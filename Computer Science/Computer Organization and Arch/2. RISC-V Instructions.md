# Datapath
ALU+Registers+Internall busses
1. Instruction read from memory
2. Load data into registers
3. Processed by ALU
	- There are a few wire connected to ALU
		- Each wire represent 1 bit
		- $2^{n}$ number of operation can be assigned
	- Takes two input, and return one operand
4. Read or write to memory
	- Only Load/Store instruction goes to memory
5. Results written to registers
	- By repeting 1~4

# Design Principle
## 1. Simplicity favours regularity
Simpler implementation

Enables higher performance lower cost

## 2. Smaller is faster

## 3. Make the Common Case Faster
Small constants are common
- Like 0

Immediate operand aviods an expensive load instruction

## 4. Good Design demands good compromises
- Different instruction formats complicate decoding, but allow 32-bit instructions uniformly

# Operands
## Register Operands
Arithmetic instructions use register operands
- RISC-V has $32\times 32$-bit register
- Use for requently accessed data
- $32$-bit(4 bytes) data called a word
- Note that $x_{0}$ is hard-coded to the constant 0

## Memory Operands
Where is memory used?
- Main memory used for composite data, such as arrays, structures, dynamic data.
- Store/Load values between memory and register

Memory is byte addressed
- Each addressed identifies an 8-bit byte

RISC-V does not require words to be aligned in memory, except for instructions and the stack

Memory operations are slow
- Because data conveyment between memory and CPU is slow
- This means instructions that require memory operations take longer than instruction that don't

### Registers vs Memory
Register is faster to accesses
- Compiler must use registers for variables as much as possible
- Only spill to memory for less frequently used variables
- Register optimization is important

## Immediate Operands
Constant data(Immediate value) is specified in an instruction
- The value is stored in the instruction itself, not in register
- Since each instruction has limited bits, the value is limited

# Representing Instruction
Instruction are encoded in binary
- Called Machine Code

RISC-V Instruction
- Encoded as 32-bit words
- Consist of opcode, register numbers, etc
- Format
	- R-Type: Opcode and 3 registers
	- I-Type: Opcode, 2 registers and 1 immediate value
	- S-Typle: Store

Each instruction consist of field, segment of an instruction, which may represent
- Register Number
- Opcode: Operation code
- Immediate Values

## R-Type Instruction
Instruction
$$\small\text{(Opcode)}\quad  \text{(Destination Register), } \text{ (Source Register 1), } \text{ (Source Register 2)}$$

Format
![[Pasted image 20250118001354.png|600]]

Instruction field
- Opcode: Operation code
- funct7: An additional opcode field
- rs2: Second register source operand
- rs1: First register source operand
- rd: Register Destination
- funct3: An additional opcode field

## I-Type Instruction
Used by Immediate instruction and load instruction
$$\small\text{(Opcode)}\quad  \text{(Destination Register), } \text{ (Source Register 1), } \text{ (Immediate Value)}$$

Format
![[Pasted image 20250120154111.png|600]]

Immediate value can be between $-2^{11}$ ~ $2^{11}-1$
- Or $0$ ~ $2^{12}$

## S-Type Instruction
Store Instruction

Format
![[Pasted image 20250120160542.png|600]]

12 bit immediate is split into two field, lower 5 bits and upper 7 bits

# Binary Integers
Given $n$-bit number with bits $x_{n-1}, x_{n-2}\dots x_{1}, x_{0}$
- $x=x_{n-1}2^{n-1}+x_{n-2}2^{n-2}\dots x_{1}2^{1}+x_{0}2^{0}$

## Numbering of bits in RISC-V
![[Pasted image 20250118142702.png|500]]
Right to left numbering in a doubleword
- Least significant bit: Rightmost bit (numbering 0)
- Most significant bit: Leftmost bit (numbering 31)

Thus, we can express $2^{32}$ different pattern
- $0$ ~ $2^{32}-1$ : *Unsigned numbers*
	- Overflow: When the result of operation cannot be represented by rightmost hardware bits
- $-2^{31}$ ~ $2^{31}-1$ : *two's complement* representation
	- Leading 0s mean positive, Leading 1s mean negative
	- All negatives have 1 at the most significant bit, thus computer can distinguish positive or negative by checking one bit
		- This bit is called *sign bit*

### Useful Shortcuts from Two's Complement
1. Negating two's complement binary
	- Invert every 0 to 1 and vice versa, then add 1
		- Let it $\bar{x}$
	- $x+\bar{x}=-1$
2. Sign Extension: Converting binary number represented in $n$-bits to a number represented with more than $n$-bits
	- Take the most significant bit from smaller quantity, replicate it to fill the new bits of the larger quantity

# Logical Operation
| Operation              | RISC-V    |                 |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Shift Left             | sll, slli | Multiply by two |
| Shift Right            | srl, srli | Divide by two   |
| Shift Right Arithmetic | sra, srai |                 |
| Bit-by-bit And         | and, andi |                 |
| Bit-by-bit Or          | or, ori   |                 |
| Bit-by-bit Not         | xor, xori |                 |

# Conditional Operations
Branch to a labeled instruction if a condition is true
- Otherwise, continue sequencially
- Label represents a *memory address of instruction*

**Ex)**
$\text{beq}\quad\text{rs1, rs2, L1}$
- If $\text{rs1==rs2}$, then branch to instruction labeled $\text{L1}$

## Compiling Loop Statements
```c
i=0;
while (save[i] == k) {i+=1;}
// i in x22, k in x24, address of save in x25
```

C code above is compiled as following:
```
Loop: slli x10, x22, 2  ; x10 =i*4
	  add x10, x10, x25 ; x10 = address of save[i]
	  lw x9 (0)x10      ; load save[i] in x9
	  bne x9, x24, Exit ; go to Exit if save[i] != k
	  addi x22,x22,1    ; i += 1
	  beg x0, x0, Loop  ; Jump to loop start
Exit:
```

**Note)** Since we want memory address of index of $i$ and each word is 4 byte, we shift $i$ by 2 to multiply 4. Then if we add that value to the pointer address of `save`, we can get memory address of array `save` at index $i$

## Basic Block
A sequence of instructions without branches(execpt at the end) and without branch targets or branch labels (except at the beginning)
- A compiler identifies basic blocks for optimization 
- An advanced processor can accelerate execution of basic blocks

## Signed vs Unsigned Comparison
Negative integers in two's complement look like large numbers in unsigned notation
- Unsigned comparison of $x<y$ checks if $x$ is negative as well as if $x$ is less than $y$

**Ex)**
Let 
$x_{22}= 1111\text{ }1111\text{ }1111\text{ }1111\text{ }1111\text{ }1111\text{ }1111\text{ }1111$
$x_{23}=0000\text{ }0000\text{ }0000\text{ }0000\text{ }0000\text{ }0000\text{ }0000\text{ }0001$

If $x_{22}<x_{23}$ , then $x_{22}=-1$
- Signed comparison

If $x_{22}>x_{23}$, then $x_{22}=4,294,967,295$ 
- Unsigned Comparison

**Note)** Register do not have any data type, is just a place for bits. The program determines how they are interpreted

# Supporting Procedures(Function) in Computer Hardware
Code reuse abstraction
- Pass values and return results
- Procedure must not alter state outside of itself

Required steps
 1. Put parameters in a place where the procedure can access them. 
 2. Transfer control to the procedure. 
 3. Acquire the storage resources needed for the procedure. 
 4. Perform the desired task. 
 5. Put the result value in a place where the calling program can access it. 
 6. Return control to the point of

Caller
- Program that instigate a procedure and provides the necessary parameter values
- Puts parameter values in parameter register and calls `jal` instruction

Callee
- Executed procedure based on provided parameter
- Returns control to the caller

## Associating Register and Instruction
Associating Register
- x10~x17 : Eight parameter registers
	- Pass parameters or return values
- x1 : Return Address Register
	- Return to the point of origin

jump-and-link instruction (`jal`)
- Branches to an address and simultaneously saves the address of the following instruction to the destination register
- `jal x1 ProcedureAddress`
	- Jump to ProcedureAddress and write return address to x1

Jump-and-link
