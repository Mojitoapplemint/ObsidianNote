Suppose we have an instruction 0x00578833
- Decoding this into assembly language instruction is called "disassembly"

# Decoding Machine Code
## Step
1. Convert hex instruction into binary
	- 0x00578833 $\to$ 0000 0000 0101 0111 1000 1000 0011 
2. Figure out the opcode and instruction format
	- (rightmost 7 bits) : 0110011
	- It is R-type
3. Using funct7 and funct3, we can know which instruction it is
	- Since both funct7 and funct3 are 0, it is `add`
4. Identify registers

Decoded instruction: `add x16, x15, x5`

### Example) 
Decode 0xfdc42703
	$\to$ 1111 1101 1100 0100 0010 0111 0000 0011
	$\to$ lw x4, 2012(x8)

However, 2012 seems too big
- It is in fact, signed number in two's complement
	- Negative signed integer
	- Thus, we need to decode it
	- Substract 1 and flip 0,1

1111 1101 1100 - 1 = 1111 1101 1011

$\to$ 0000 0010 0100 = -36

Decoded instruction: `lw x14 -36(x8)`
