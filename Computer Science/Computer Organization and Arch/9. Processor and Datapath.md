# Instruction Execution
1. Send the program counter (PC) to the memory that contains the code and fetch the instruction from that memory. 
2. Read one or two registers, using fields of the instruction to select the registers to read.
3. Depending on instruction class(type)
	- Use ALU to calculate
		- Arithmetic
		- Memory address for load/store
		- Branch comparison
	- Store result in register
	- Access data memory for load/store
	- PC $\leftarrow$ (target address or PC) +4
4. Repeat

## Multiplexor: Data selection
Sometime, data is going to a particular unit from two different source, and we need to select one.
- e.g. depending on `add` or `addi`, the second data comes from register or immediate field of instruction
- These data lines cannot simply be wired together; we must add a logic element that chooses from among the multiple sources and steers one of those sources to its destination

**Multiplexor**
- It selects from among several inputs based on the setting of its control lines. 
- The control lines are set based primarily on information taken from the instruction being executed
- $2^{n}$ data inputs + $n$ control inputs = $1$ data output
	- Each AND gate is enabled by a different combination of inputs

## Combinational Elements
AND-gate
- $Y=A\,\&\,B$
![[Pasted image 20250316181130.png|150]]

Adder
- $Y=A+B$
![[Pasted image 20250316181218.png|150]]

Multiplexer
- If $S$, then return $|1$, else $|0$
![[Pasted image 20250316181301.png|150]]

ALU
- Contains logical gates, such as
- $Y=F(A,B)$ where $F=\{ \text{ADD, SUB, AND, ORR} \}$
![[Pasted image 20250316181411.png|150]]

A control unit, which has the instruction as an input, is used to determine how to set the control lines for the functional units and two of the multiplexors

# Clocking Methodology
Each signal is either asserted or deasserted
- Asserted: When signal is high(1)
- Deasserted: When signal is low(0)

Clocking methodology defines when signals can be read and when they can be written
- We use Edge-triggered methodology: Updating happens when clock changes from 0 to 1
![[Pasted image 20250316193732.png|300]]

If a state element is not updated on every clock, i.e. if the stored value is required later, then an explicit write control signal is required
- Register only updates on clock edge when write control input is 1
![[Pasted image 20250316193747.png|300]]

Combinational logic transforms data during clock cycles
- Between clock edges
- Input from state elements, output to state element
- Longest delay determines clock period

# Building a Datapath
Datapath is the elements that process data and addresses in the CPU

## R-Format Instructions
- Read two register operands 
- Perform arithmetic/logical operation 
- Write register result 
- Inputs from instruction select register #’s 
- Register outputs are “always-on”, selected by read inputs 
- Control signals enable write to registers and select ALU operation

## Load/Store Instructions
- Read register operands
- ImmeGen: Take 32 bit intruction input and return immediate value
- Load: Read memory and update register
- Store: Write register value to memory

### R-Type/Load/Store Datapath
![[Pasted image 20250316195725.png|500]]

## Branch Instructions
- Read register operands
- Compare operands
	- Use ALU, substract and compare with zero
- Calculate target address
	- Use sign-extend displacement
	- Shift left 1 place (for halfword displacement)
	- Add to PC value

# ALU Control
Based on 2-bit ALUOp derived from opcode, funct3 and funct7 field, ALU control generate 4 bits that tells ALU which function to operate
- 0000 $\to$ AND
- 0001 $\to$ OR
- 0010 $\to$ ADD
- 0110 $\to$ SUB

# Pipeline
Recall that longest delay determines clock period because it is not feasible to vary period for different instructions
- Ususally load instruction
- But this violates design principle: making the common case fast

![[Pasted image 20250316202404.png|400]]

## RISC-V Pipeline
Five stages, one step per stage
1. IF: Instruction fetch from memory
2. ID: Instruction decode & register read
3. EX: Execute operation or calculate address
4. MEM: Access memory operand
5. WB: Write result back to register

## Pipeline Speedup
Speedup due to increased throughput
- Time for each instruction does not decrease

If all stages are balanced, i.e. all take the same time
$$\text{(Time between Instruction)}_{\text{pipelined}} = \frac{\text{(Time between Instruction)}_{\text{nonpipelined}}}{\text{\# stages}}$$

# Hazards
Situations that prevent starting the next instruction in the next cycle

## Structure hazards
When the hardware structure cannot support the pipelining
- A requried resource is busy
![[Pasted image 20250318110517.png|400]]
- At cycle 4, two stages are accessing the memory, so if only one momory access is available at a time, the hardware cannot support this
- We need to postpone the 4'th instruction 1 cycle back

## Data hazard
When the overlapped instruction is dependent on other instructions
- Need to wait for previous instruction to complete its data read/write
![[Pasted image 20250318111037.png|450]]
- Since `sub` and `and` instruction are both using the `r1` register, it will read wrong value because they are reading before `r1` is being updated

### Forwarding(Bypassing)
The way to prevent Data hazard
- Instead of waiting for data from the previous instruction to be stored in the register, as soon as the data is ready, bring that data directly from additional datapath
![[Pasted image 20250318153949.png|400]]
- Here, instead of wating the value to be stored in the register, as soon as arithmetic is done from ALU, the data that is supposed to be stored in $r_{1}$ is directly forwarded to the second instruction

### Load-Use Data Hazard
Forwarding cannot solve all data hazard
- If value is not even computed when needed
- Then, we need to reorder code to avoid use of load result in the next instruction
![[Pasted image 20250318163251.png|500]]

Control hazard
- Deciding on control action depends on previous instruction
