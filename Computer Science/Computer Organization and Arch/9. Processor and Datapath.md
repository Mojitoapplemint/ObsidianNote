# Instruction Execution
1. Send the program counter (PC) to the memory that contains the code and fetch the instruction from that memory. 
2. Read one or two registers, using fields of the instruction to select the registers to read.
3. Depending on instruction class(type)
	- Use ALU to calculate
		- Arithmetic
		- Memory address for load/store
		- Branch comparison
	- Store result in register
	- Access data memory for load/store
	- PC $\leftarrow$ (target address or PC) +4
4. Repeat

## Multiplexers: Data selection
Sometime, data is going to a particular unit from two different source, and we need to select one.
- e.g. depending on `add` or `addi`, the second data comes from register or immediate field of instruction
