Suppose we have an instruction 0x00578833
- Decoding this into assembly language instruction is called "disassembly"

# Decoding Machine Code
## Step
1. Convert hex instruction into binary
	- 0x00578833 $\to$ 0000 0000 0101 0111 1000 1000 0011 
2. Figure out the opcode and instruction format
	- (rightmost 7 bits) : 0110011
	- It is R-type
3. Using funct7 and funct3, we can know which instruction it is
	- Since both funct7 and funct3 are 0, it is `add`
4. Identify registers

Decoded instruction: `add x16, x15, x5`

### Example) 
Decode 0xfdc42703
	$\to$ 1111 1101 1100 0100 0010 0111 0000 0011
	$\to$ lw x4, 2012(x8)

However, 2012 seems too big
- It is in fact, signed number in two's complement
	- Negative signed integer
	- Thus, we need to decode it
	- Substract 1 and flip 0,1

1111 1101 1100 - 1 = 1111 1101 1011

$\to$ 0000 0010 0100 = -36

Decoded instruction: `lw x14 -36(x8)`

# Overview

# Compiler
Translate high-level language to assembly language
- Scanning pahse to identify tokens
- Parsing to build syntax tree
- Semantic Analysis
	- Check language rule
	- Type checking
	- Variable declaration
	- Build symbol table
- Generate Intermediate Representation
	- Like generic assembly language
	- Looks like assembly language, but does not based on specific ISA
	- a.k.a Register Transfer Language
- Optimization
- Register Allocation
- Generate ISA-specific machine code

# Assembler
Takes assembly code, and outputs machine code
- Translate pseudoinstruction to actual instruction
- Convert far branches into branch+jump
- Large constant $\to$ multiple instruction
- Keeps track of labels used in branches and data transfer instruction in **symbol table**
	- Matches names of labels to the addresses
- Generates machine code in an **object file**

## Producing Object Module
![[Pasted image 20250202155128.png|300]]

Assembler (or compiler) provides information for building a complete program from the pieces

Object file header 
- Describes the size and position of the other pieces of object file

Text segment
- Contains the machine language code. 

Static data segment 
- Contains data allocated for the life of the program.

Relocation information 
- Identifies instructions and data words that depend on absolute addresses when the program is loaded into memory.

Symbol table 
- Contains the remaining labels that are not defined, such as external references. 

Debugging information
- Contains a concise description of how the modules were compiled so that a debugger can associate machine instructions with C source files and make data structures readable.

## Pseudoinstruction
A common variation of assembly language instructions often treated as if it were an instruction in its own right
- The assembler convert the pseudoinstruction into the machine language equivalent to assembly instruction corresponds to the pseudoinstruction

**Ex)**
``` 
1)
li x9, 123 // Load immediate 123 to x9
-> addi x9, x0, 123

2)
mv x10, x11 // x10 gets x11
-> addi, x10, x11, 0
```

# Linker (Link Editor)
A single change of one procedure requires compiling and assembling the whole program
- In case of library, since we would never change the source code, compiling and assembling code from library would be waste
- Therefore, we instead compile and assemble each procedure independently
	- This requries a new system, called linker which takes all independently assembled machine language and link them together

Steps
- Place code and data modules symbolically in memory
- Determine the address of data and instruction labels
- Patch both the internal and external references

Uses relocation table and symbol table in each object module to resolve all undefined labels
- 

## Steps
1. Examine all code and data modules
2. Get addresses of all data and instruction labels
3. "Patch" all references to eliminate conflicts
4. Resolve external references
5. Pack everything together as an executable file

## Linking Object Modules
Produces an executable image
- Merges segments
- Resolve labels
- Patch location-dependent and external references

Could leave location dependentcies for fixing by a relocating loader
- But with virtual memory, no need to do this
- Program can be loaded into absolute location in virtual memory space

# Loader
Load from image file on disk into memory
