# A Safe Place for Data

	- SSD
	- CDROM, DVD
	- etc

# Technology Trend
## Transistors and Semiconductors
Transistor: On/Off switch controlled with electricity

Silicon: Semiconductor - does not conduct electricity well
- We can control it
- We can make conductors, insulator, or transistor by adding more materials

## Integrated Circuit (IC)
After transistor is invented, people start putting a lot of small transistors on a single chip, is called Integrated Circuit
- SSI: Small Scale Integration (10's)
- MSI: Medium Scale Integration (100's/1000's)
- LSI: Large Scale Integration (10,000's)
- VLSI: Very Large Scale Integration
- ULSI: Ultra Large Scale Integration

## Moore's Law
Prediction made by Gordon Moore in 1965 that transistor counts in IC will double every 18 months
- Ended in 2018

# Performance

## Machine Instruction
Native Language of Processor
- Primitive operations performed by the CPU

Classes of instructions
- Arithmetic
- Control Logic
- Load data to/from CPU

Instruction Set
- Set of instructions supported by a processor

## Performance Dependency
Performance is influenced by following 4 elements
1. Algorithm
	- Determines number of operation execeuted
2. Programming Language, Compiler, Architecture
	- Determines number of machine instructions executred per operation
3. Processor and memory system
	- Determine how fast instructions are executed
4. I/O System
	- Determines how fast I/O operations are executed
	- That is, how fast can be moved between deviced, memory and processor

## How can we define "Performance?"
What Performance refers depends on the problem
- Which aspect(function) that we would want to optimize? 
- Must think about the tradeoff

## Response Time and Throughput
Response Time
- How long it takes to do a task

Throughput
- Total work done per unit time

## Relative Performance
$$\text{(Performance)}=\frac{1}{\text{(Execution Time)}}$$
"$X$ is $n$ times faster than $Y$"
- $\frac{\text{Performance of }X}{\text{Performance of }Y}=n$

## Measuring Execution Time
Elapsed Time
- Total response time, including all aspects
- Determines system performance

**CPU Time**
- Time spent processing a given job
- Comprises use CPU time and system CPU time
- Different programs are affected differently by CPU and system performance

## CPU Time and Clocking
![[Pasted image 20250108164521.png|600]]
Operation of digital hardware governed by a constant rate clock
- Clock Period : Duration of a clock cycle in seconds
- Clock Rate(Frequency) : Cycles per second

Then,
$$\text{Clock Rate}=\frac{1}{\text{Cycle Time}}$$
Therefore, 
$$\text{CPU Time}=\text{Clock Cycles}\times\text{Cycle Time}=\frac{\text{Clock Cycles}}{\text{Clock Rate}}$$

## Instruction Count and CPI(Cycles per Instruction)

$$\text{Clock Cycles}=\text{Instruction Count(IC)}\times\text{CPI}$$
$$\text{CPU Time}=\text{IC}\times\text{CPI}\times\text{Cycle Time}$$
$$=\frac{\text{IC}\times\text{CPI}}{\text{Clock Rate}}$$

CPI referes to number of required cycles for each instruction
- Instruction Count is determiend by program, ISA, and compiler

### Weighted Average CPI
Number of Cycles may differ depends on classes of instruction
- In other word, CPI may differ depends on classes of instruction
- Then, we calculate Clock Cycles of each instructions and take sum of them
$$\text{Clock Cycles}=\sum^{n}_{i=1}(\text{CPI}_{i}\times\text{IC}_{i})$$
Then,
$$\text{CPI} = \frac{\text{Clock Cycles}}{\text{total IC}}=\sum^{n}_{i=1}\left( \text{CPI}_{i}\times\frac{\text{IC}_{i}}{\text{total IC}} \right) $$
- $\frac{\text{IC}_{i}}{\text{total IC}}$ referes to Relative frequency 

## RE: Performance Dependency
Algorithm
- Affects IC, possibly CPI
Programming language
- Affects IC, CPI
Compiler
- Affects IC, CPI
ISA
- Affects IC, CPI, T$_{c}$

# Power
$$\text{Power}=\text{Capacitive Load}\times\text{Voltage}^{2}\times\text{Frequency}$$

More Power more cooling required

Capacitive Load: Energy stored in a circuit
- Higher with more transistors

If Voltage is too low, transistors get "leaky"
- Power is wasted

## Power Wall
Frequency is function of clock rate
- Since required gets larger as frequency gets higher, people have been decreased voltage to balance it.
- However, if the *voltage is too low, then the transistor becomes too leaky*

Attaching strong cooling system is also unrealistic for personal PC and mobile devices
- There is a limit of removing heat

$\implies$ How can be still improve performance?

# Multiprocessors
Rather than continuing to decrease the response time of one program running on the single processor, people start microprocessor using multi processors per chip
- Such processor is called multicore microprocessor
	- "Processors" in a chip is called **core**
- Main benefit is more on throughput than on response time

## Parallelism
