# Hardware, Software, Performance and Power
- Both Hardware and Software affect performance and power efficiency
- Algorithm determines number of high-level language statements
- Language, compiler, and architecture determines the number of machine-level instructions required for the program
- Processor and memory implementation determines how fast and how much power is used to execute machine-level instructions

# Pervasive Computing


# Traditional Classes of Computer
Personal Computer
- GEneral purpose, variety of saftware
- subject to cost/performance tradeoff

Server Computer
- Often general purpose
- Network based
- High capacity, performance, reliability
- Range from small servers to building sized

Super Computer
- High-end scientific and engineering calculations
- Highest capability but represent a small fraction of the overall computer market

Embedded Systems
- Hidden as components of dedicated purpose systems
- Usually stringent power/performance/cost constraints
