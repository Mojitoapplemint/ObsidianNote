- Abstraction helps dealing with complexity
	- Hide lower-level details
- Instruction set architecture (ISA)
	- The hardware/software Interface
- Application Binary Interface(ABI)
	- The ISA + System Software(OS) interface
- Implementation
	- The details underlying an interface
# A Safe Place for Data
Volatile Main Memory (RAM)
- Loses instructions and data when power off

Non-Volatile Secondary Memory
- Persistent Storage
	- SSD
	- CDROM, DVD
	- etc

# Technology Trend
## Transistors and Semiconductors
Transistor: On/Off switch controlled with electricity

Silicon: Semiconductor - does not conduct electricity well
- We can control it
- We can make conductors, insulator, or transistor by adding more materials

## Integrated Circuit (IC)
After transistor is invented, people start putting a lot of small transistors on a single chip, is called Integrated Circuit
- SSI: Small Scale Integration (10's)
- MSI: Medium Scale Integration (100's/1000's)
- LSI: Large Scale Integration (10,000's)
- VLSI: Very Large Scale Integration
- ULSI: Ultra Large Scale Integration

## Moore's Law
Prediction made by Gordon Moore in 1965 that transistor counts in IC will double every 18 months
- Ended in 2018

# Performance
## How each element influence performance?
1. Algorithm
	- Determines number of operation execeuted
2. Programming Language, Compiler, Architecture
	- Determines number of machine instructions executred per operation
3. Processor and memory system
	- Determine how fast instructions are executed
4. I/O System
	- Determines how fast I/O operations are executed
	- That is, how fast can be moved between deviced, memory and processor

## How can we define "Performance?"
What Performance refers depends on the problem
- Which aspect(function) that we would want to optimize? 
- Must think about the tradeoff

## Response Time and Throughput
Response Time
- How long it takes to do a task

Throughput
- Total work done per unit time

## Relative Performance
$$\text{(Performance)}=\frac{1}{\text{(Execution Time)}}$$
"$X$ is $n$ times faster than $Y$"
- $\frac{\text{Performance of }X}{\text{Performance of }Y}=n$

## Measuring Execution Time
Elapsed Time

CPU Time

## CPU Time and Clocking
![[Pasted image 20250108164521.png|600]]
Operation of digital hardware governed by a constant rate clock
- Clock Period : Duration of a clock cycle in seconds
- Clock Rate(Frequency) : Cycles per second

Then,
$$\text{Clock Rate}=\frac{1}{\text{Cycle Time}}$$
Therefore, 
$$\text{CPU Time}=\text{Cycles}\times\text{Cycle Time}=\frac{\text{Cycles}}{\text{Clock Rate}}$$
# Machine Instruction
Native Language of Processor

## Instruction Count and CPI(Cycles per Instruction)

$$\text{Clock Cycles}=\text{Instruction Count(IC)}\times\text{CPI}$$
$$\text{CPU Time}=\text{IC}\times\text{CPI}\times\text{Clock Cycle Time}$$
$$=\frac{\text{IC}\times\text{CPI}}{\text{Clock Rate}}$$

CPI referes to number of required cycles for each instruction
- Instruction Count is determiend by program, ISA, and compiler

Number of Cycles may differ depends on classes of instruction
- In other word, CPI may differ depends on classes of instruction
	- Take the average

Average Cycles per instruction
- Determined by CPU hardware
