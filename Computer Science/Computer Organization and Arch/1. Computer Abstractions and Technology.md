- Abstraction helps dealing with complexity
	- Hide lower-level details
- Instruction set architecture (ISA)
	- The hardware/software Interface
- Application Binary Interface(ABI)
	- The ISA + System Software(OS) interface
- Implementation
	- The details underlying an interface
# A Safe Place for Data
Volatile Main Memory (RAM)
- Loses instructions and data when power off

Non-Volatile Secondary Memory
- Persistent Storage
	- SSD
	- CDROM, DVD
	- etc

# Technology Trend
## Transistors and Semiconductors
## Integrated Circuit (IC)

## Moore's Law

# Performance
## How each element influence performance?
1. Algorithm
	- Determines number of operation execeuted
2. Programming Language, Compiler, Architecture
	- Determines number of machine instructions executred per operation
3. Processor and memory system
	- Determine how fast instructions are executed
4. I/O System
	- Determines how fast I/O operations are executed
	- That is, how fast can be moved between deviced, memory and processor

## How can we define "Performance?"
What Performance refers depends on the problem

- Which aspect(function) that we would want to optimize?
