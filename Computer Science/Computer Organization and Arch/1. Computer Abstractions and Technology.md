# Hardware, Software, Performance and Power
- Both Hardware and Software affect performance and power efficiency
- Algorithm determines number of high-level language statements
- Language, compiler, and architecture determines the number of machine-level instructions required for the program
- Processor and memory implementation determines how fast and how much power is used to execute machine-level instructions

# Traditional Classes of Computer
Personal Computer
- General purpose, variety of saftware
- subject to cost/performance tradeoff

Server Computer
- Often general purpose
- Network based
- High capacity, performance, reliability
- Range from small servers to building sized

Super Computer
- High-end scientific and engineering calculations
- Highest capability but represent a small fraction of the overall computer market

Embedded Systems
- Hidden as components of dedicated purpose systems
- Usually stringent power/performance/cost constraints

# Seven Great Ideas in Comp. Arch
1. Use abstraction to simplify design
	- Abstractions at different levels to hide details and present a simpler model at higher level
2. Make the common case fast
	- Put more effort optimizing thing that happen often
	- Need to understand common case vs rare case
3. Performance via Parallelism
	- Do more than one thing at a time
4. Performance via pipelining
	- A specific type of parallelism
	- Start something new before finishing previous thing
5. Performance via prediction
	- If you don't know what to do next, guess and start now instead of waiting until you know for sure
6. Hierarchy of memories
	- Ideal memory is large, fast and cheap
	- Reality requires tradeoffs
	- Fast, small, expensive at top
	- Slow, large, cheap at bottom
	- Chaches
7. Dependability via redundancies
	- Use redundant components; hardware will fail
	- Need to detect failures; what about the data?

# Below Program
Application software
- Written in High-Level Language(HLL)
- C, Java, etc
System Software
- Compiler: Translates HLL to machine code
- Operating System: Service code
	- Handling I/O
	- Managing memory and storage
	- Scheduling tasks & sharing resources
Hardware
- Processor, memory, I/O

## Levels of Program Code
HLL
- Level of abstraction close to problem domain
- Provides productivity
