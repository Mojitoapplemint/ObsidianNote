# Front End
Scanning
- Read characters from source, create tokens
- Token: Reserved words, operators, names

Parsing
- Check syntax
- Produce Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

Semantic Analysis
- Check sematic correctness
- Type checking build Symbol table

Generate Intermediate Representation(IR)
- Symbol Table + AST $\to$ IR
- Simple operations on small set of primitives
- Multiple HLL $\to$ Same IR
	- Specifies program function independent of original source
- Often RISC like instructions set, with unlimited virtual registers

# Optimization
## High-Level Optimizations
Source code level

Ex)
Procedure in-ligning
- Replaces call to function with body of function

Loop unrolling : 
- Replicate code in loop with fewer loop iterations

## Local Optimization
Within a basic block
- Common subexpression Elimination
- Strength reduce
