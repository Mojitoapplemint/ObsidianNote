Parallelism through pipelining instructions

# Abstract
Deeper Pipeline to overlap more instruction
- If single task takes longer than others, then divide that into subtasks and consider each subtask as another stage of parallelism
	- To get full speed up, we need to rebalance the remaining steps, aiming for identical durations
- Less work per stage $\Rightarrow$ Shorter clock cycle $\Rightarrow$ GHZ goes up

Multiple Issues
- Replicate internal components of the computer
	- Start multiple instructions per clock cycle
- This allows CPI to be less than 1
	- So use instruction per cycle(IPC)
