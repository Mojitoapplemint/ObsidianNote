Parallelism through pipelining instructions

# Abstract
Deeper Pipeline to overlap more instruction
- If single task takes longer than others, then divide that into subtasks and consider each subtask as another stage of parallelism
	- To get full speed up, we need to rebalance the remaining steps, aiming for identical durations
- Less work per stage $\Rightarrow$ Shorter clock cycle $\Rightarrow$ GHZ goes up

Multiple Issues
- Replicate internal components of the computer
	- Start multiple instructions per clock cycle
- This allows CPI to be less than 1
	- So use instruction per cycle(IPC)

# Multiple-issue Datapath
Two ways to implement multiple issue
- Division of work between compiler and hardware

## Static Multiple Issue
Compiler packages instructions into issue slots
- Compiler will also handles data and control hazards statistically

## Dynamic Multiple Issue
Packaging instruction is done by processor
- It examines instruction stream and chooses instructions to issue each cycle
- Compiler can help by reordering instructions

CPU resolves hazards at runtime
- Requires extra hardware

# Speculation
An approach that allows the compiler or the processor to "guess" about properties of an instruction, to enable execution to begin for other instructions that may depend on the speculated instruction
- Start operation ASAP
- Check whether guess was right
	- If so, complete the operation
	- If not, roll-back and do the right thing

## Compiler vs Hardware Speculation
Compiler 
- Can reorder instructions, moving an instruction across a branch or a load across a store
- Can include "fix-up" instructions to recover from incorrect guess

Processor can do the same transformation at runtime
- Buffer results until it determines they are actually needed
- Flush buffers on incorrect speculation

# Static Multiple Issue
Compiler groups instructions into “issue packets”
- Group of instructions that there are *no dependencies with each other*
- Determined by pipeline resources required
- e.g. an add and a load instruction

Think of an issue packet as a very long instruction
- Specifies multiple concurrent operations
- Also called Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW)

## Scheduling
Compiler must remove some/all hazards
- Reorder instructions into issue packets 
- No dependencies within a packet
- Possibly some dependencies between packets 
	- Varies between ISAs; compiler must know! 
- Pad with `nop` (no-operation) if necessary
