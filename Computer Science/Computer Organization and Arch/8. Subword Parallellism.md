Graphics and audio applications can take advantaegs of performing simultaneous operations on short vectors

Using 128-bit adder
- Sixteen 8-bit adds
- Eight 16-bits adds
- Four 32-bit adds
are available in parallel

## Using AVX: Intel C Intrinsics
Intel Intrinsics are built-in functions provided by compilers (like GCC) that directly use CPU instructions without writing assembly language
- These functions map directly to SIMD instructions
- Compiler automaticall maps intrinsic variables(e.g. `__m128`, `__m256`, `__m512`) to physical SIMD regiters(XMM, YMM, ZMM)
- If there are more SIMD variables than available registers, the compiler spills them to memory, which affect performance

Middle ground between handwritten assembly and high-level C code
- Let `a,b,x` are type `__m128`
- `x=_mm_add_ps(a,b) -> addps xmm0, xmm1` 

## Example 1. Dot Product

where `_mm_hadd_ps` instruction does following:

Algorithm ($C=A\times B$)
- Load the first row from $C$ in register
- Load the first entry of the first row and broadcast it(duplicate value in all eight entries of the register)
- Load the first row of $A$
- `_mm512_fmadd_pd`
	- Multiply $i^{th}$ entry of $A$ and $B$, then add that to $C$
	- ![[Pasted image 20250316153456.png|400]]
- Store this register value to $C$
