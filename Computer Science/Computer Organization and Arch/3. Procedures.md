# Branch Addressing
RISC-V Branch instruction use SB-format
- 12-bit immediate field
- Can branch to addresses from $-4096$ to $4094$ (*in multiples of two*)
	- Branch address works in half word
	- 

Jump instruction (`jal`) uses UJ-format
- Like U-format, but different Encoding

PC relative addressing
- If all program address had to fit in $2^{20}$, we could only have small programs
- Instead of using absolute value of memory address, it addresses with the relative difference between two branches
	- $\text{Branch Target} =\text{PC + Branch offset}$
	- PC contains address of current instruction
- When compiler compile program, it tries to put branches close to each other


# Supporting Procedures(Function) in Computer Hardware
Code reuse abstraction
- Pass values and return results
- Procedure should not alter state outside of itself

Required steps
 1. Put parameters in a place where the procedure can access them. 
 2. Transfer control to the procedure. 
 3. Acquire the storage resources needed for the procedure. 
 4. Perform the desired task. 
 5. Put the result value in a place where the calling program can access it. 
 6. Return control to the point of

Caller
- Program that instigate a procedure and provides the necessary parameter values
- Puts parameter values in parameter register and calls `jal` instruction

Callee
- Executed procedure based on provided parameter
- Returns control to the caller

## Associating Register and Instruction
![[Pasted image 20250126220346.png]]

jump-and-link instruction (`jal`)
- Branches to an address and simultaneously saves the address of the following instruction to the destination register
- `jal x1 ProcedureAddress`
	- Jump(Branches) to ProcedureAddress and write return address to x1
	- Address of following instruction put in x1
		- Return Address

Jump-and-link register instruction (`jalr`)
- `jalr x0, 0(x1)`
- Branches to address stored in x1
- We don't need the return address anymore, so specify x0
	- Using existing instruction format

## Using More Register
If procedure needs to use more registers than 8, we need to preserve contents in memory
- By stack that grows downward
- x2 register(sp) holds address of "top" of stack (lowest address)

### Steps
1. Adjust sp to allocate memory for register
	- We need to add $-4*\text{(\# word)}$ to sp
2. Save Register to allocate memory in stack : `sw`
3. Execute instruction
4. Put return value in x10
	- Or x11, if needed
5. Restore values of the register from the stack
	- Popping : `lw`
	- Careful for order of popping
6. Ends procedure by using return address

### Saved Register vs Temporary Register
x5−x7 and x28−x31
- Temporary registers that are not preserved by the callee (called procedure) on a procedure call 
- Don't have to save and restore

x8−x9 and x18−x27
- Saved registers that must be preserved on a procedure call (if used, the callee saves and restores them)

## Nested Procedures
Leaf Procedure
- Procedures that do not call others

Non-Leaf Procedure
- Procedure that call other procedure

1. The caller pushes any argument registers (x10–x17) or temporary registers (x5-x7 and x28-x31) that are needed after the call
2. The callee pushes the return address register x1 and any saved registers (x8- x9 and x18-x27) used by the callee. 
3. The stack pointer sp is adjusted to account for the number of registers placed on the stack. Upon the return, the registers are restored from memory, and the stack pointer is readjusted.

# Space Allocation

Text
- Executable Code
- Instructions

Static Data
- Global variables

## On the Stack
Stack is also used to store variables that are local to the procedure but do not fit in registers, such as local arrays or structures
- **Procedure Frame:** Segment of the stack containing a procedure's saved registers and local variable
	- a.k.a Activation record

Frame Pointer (fp, or x8)
- Point to the first word of the frame
- Offers a stable base register within a procedure for local memory-reference
- When a frame pointer is used, it is initialized using the address in sp on a call, and sp is restored using fp

## On the Heap
Stores Dynamic data
- e.g. malloc() in C, new in Java
