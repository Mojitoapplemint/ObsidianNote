# Principle of Locality
Program access a relatively small portion of their address space at any instant of time

Temporal Locality
- Item accessed recently are likely to be accessed again soon

Spatial Locality(Locality of access)
Items near those accessed recently are likely to be accessed soon

# Memory Hierarchy
Block(Cache line)
- Unit of copying
- Maybe multiple words

Hit
- Access satisfied by upper level
	- Accessed data is present in upper level
- $\text{Hit Ratio}=\frac{\text{\# hits}}{\text{\# Accesses}}$

Miss
- Accessed data is absent; blocked copied from lower level
	- Then accessed data supplied from upper level
- Miss penalty: Time taken for copying
- $\text{Miss Ratio}=\frac{\text{\# hits}}{\text{\# Accesses}}=1-\text{Hit Ratio}$

# Cache Memory
Storage managed to take advantage of locality of access

## Direct Mapped Cache
$$\text{(Cache Address)}=\text{{(Block Address) \% (\#Blocks in Cache)}}$$
- Use low-order address bits

Then, multiple memory blocks map to the same cache location
- How do we know which memory block is stored in a cache location?
- Store memory block address as well as the data

**Tag and Valid Bits**
- Rest bits excluding low-order address bits for cache address are tag
- A field in the tables of a memory hierarchy that indicates that the associated block in the hierarchy contains valid data
	- If the bit is not set, there cannot be a match for this block
	- Initially 0

## Calculating Cache Size
$n$: Required number of bits for index bits
- $2^{n}=\text{\# indices}$

$2^{m}=\text{\# words per block}$

Size of Tag $= 32-(n+m+2)$
- 2 referes to byte offset

Total Cache size $=2^{n}\times(\text{block size + tag size + 1})$
- 1 represents the valid bit

## Cache Misses
### Data Cache Misses
- Stall the CPU pipeline
- Send address value to memory 
- Fetch block from next level of hierarchy
	- L1 cache miss requires transfer from L2 cache 
	- L2 cache miss requires transfer from main memory (assuming there is no L3 cache) 
- Update appropriate cache block; upper bits of address are tag; set valid bit 
- Complete the data access (e.g. a load instruction)

### Instruction Cache Misses
If stage will be invalid; program Counter (PC) register will have already been incremented (+4) 
- Send original address in PC to memory 
- Fetch block from next level of hierarchy
	- L1 cache miss requires transfer from L2 cache 
	- L2 cache miss requires transfer from main memory 
- Update appropriate cache block; write upper bits of address to tag field; set valid bit 
- Restart execution cycle; this time IF stage will find instruction in cache 
- Proceed normally

## Cache Writing
### Write-Through
Write to both memory and cache
- Every store causes write to memory, thus no advantage from cache

Instead of writing information to the memory, use buffer to hold data waiting to be written to memory
- CPU stalls on write if write buffer is already full

### Write-Back
On data-write hit, just update the block in cache
- Keep track of whether each block is "dirty," meaning block in memory is out of date

When a dirty block is replaced
- Replacement: New data block uses same cache line
- Write it back to memory
- Use write buffer to allow replacing block to be read first
