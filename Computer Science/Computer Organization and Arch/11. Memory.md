# Principle of Locality
Program access a relatively small portion of their address space at any instant of time

Temporal Locality
- Item accessed recently are likely to be accessed again soon

Spatial Locality(Locality of access)
Items near those accessed recently are likely to be accessed soon

# Memory Hierarchy
Block(Cache line)
- Unit of copying
- Maybe multiple words

Hit
- Access satisfied by upper level
	- Accessed data is present in upper level
- $\text{Hit Ratio}=\frac{\text{\# hits}}{\text{\# Accesses}}$

Miss
- Accessed data is absent; blocked copied from lower level
	- Then accessed data supplied from upper level
- Miss penalty: Time taken for copying
- $\text{Miss Ratio}=\frac{\text{\# hits}}{\text{\# Accesses}}=1-\text{Hit Ratio}$
