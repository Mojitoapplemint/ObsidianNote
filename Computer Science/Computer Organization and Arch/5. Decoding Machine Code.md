Suppose we have an instruction 0x00578833
- Decoding this into assembly language instruction is called "disassembly"

# Step
1. Convert hex instruction into binary
	- 0x00578833 $\to$ 0000 0000 0101 0111 1000 1000 0011 
2. Figure out the opcode and instruction format
	- (rightmost 7 bits) : 0110011
	- It is R-type
3. Using funct7 and funct3, we can know which instruction it is
	- Since both funct7 and funct3 are 0, it is `add`
4. Identify registers

Decoded instruction: `add x16, x15, x5`
