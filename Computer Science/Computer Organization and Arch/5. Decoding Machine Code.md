Suppose we have an instruction 0x00578833
- Decoding this into assembly language instruction is called "disassembly"

1. Convert hex instruction into binary
	- 0x00578833 $\to$ 0000 0000 0101 0111 1000 1000 0011 
2. Figure out the opcode and instruction format
	- (rightmost 7 bits) : 0110011
	- Since this is `add` instruction, it is R-type
3.
