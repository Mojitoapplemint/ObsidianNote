# Arithmetic Operation
Design Principle: Simplicity favours regularity
- Simpler implementation
- Enables higher performance lower cost

Two sources and one destination
- $\text{add}\quad a,b,c\implies a\leftarrow b+c$

Where are variables actually stored **during** computations?
- In CPU, more specifically register

## Register
Extremely fast memory
- Located in CPU, close to Arithmetic and Logic Unit(ALU)

## Datapath
ALU+Registers+Internall busses
1. Instruction read from memory
2. Load data into registers
3. Processed by ALU
4. Read or write to memoty
5. Results written to registers
