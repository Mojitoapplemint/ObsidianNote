# Arithmetic Operation
Design Principle: Simplicity favours regularity
- Simpler implementation
- Enables higher performance lower cost

Two sources and one destination
- $\text{add}\quad a,b,c\implies a\leftarrow b+c$

Where are variables actually stored **during** computations?
- In CPU, more specifically register

## Register
Extremely fast memory
- Located in CPU, close to Arithmetic and Logic Unit(ALU)

# Datapath
ALU+Registers+Internall busses
1. Instruction read from memory
2. Load data into registers
3. Processed by ALU
	- There are a few wire connected to ALU
		- Each wire represent 1 bit
		- $2^{n}$ number of operation can be assigned
	- Takes two input, and return one operand
4. Read or write to memory
	- Only Load/Store instruction goes to memory
5. Results written to registers
	- By repeting 1~4
