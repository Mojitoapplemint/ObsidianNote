# Scheduling Example
Goal: Schedule tasks on one or more shared resources to optimize some object
- A schedule specifies an order for processing the jobs

Define jobs
- Jobs are the tasks to be completed
- They have a length $\mathscr{l}_{j}$, which is the amount of time required to process the job
- They have a weight $w_{j}$, which indicates the priority

Suppose we have $n$ jobs to schedule
- How many different schedule can be created: $n!$

The completion time $C_{j}(\sigma)$ of job $j$ in a schedule $\sigma$ is the sum of the lengths of the jobs preceding $j$ in $\sigma$ plus the length of $j$ itself
- Suppose $\mathscr{l}_{1}=1, \mathscr{l}_{2}=2, \mathscr{l}_{3}=3$ and the order is $1\to 2\to 3$
- Then completion time would be $1,1+2=3,1+2+3=6$

Objective Function: To make trade-offs between jobs, we minimize the sum of weighted
