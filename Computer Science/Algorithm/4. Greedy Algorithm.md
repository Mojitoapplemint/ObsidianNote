# Scheduling Example
Goal: Schedule tasks on one or more shared resources to optimize some object
- A schedule specifies an order for processing the jobs

Define jobs
- Jobs are the tasks to be completed
- They have a length $\mathscr{l}_{j}$, which is the amount of time required to process the job
- They have a weight $w_{j}$, which indicates the priority

Suppose we have $n$ jobs to schedule
- How many different schedule can be created: $n!$

## Completion Time $C_{j}(\sigma)$
The completion time $C_{j}(\sigma)$ of job $j$ in a schedule $\sigma$ is the sum of the lengths of the jobs preceding $j$ in $\sigma$ plus the length of $j$ itself
- Suppose $\mathscr{l}_{1}=1, \mathscr{l}_{2}=2, \mathscr{l}_{3}=3$ and the order is $1\to 2\to 3$
- Then completion time would be $1,1+2=3,1+2+3=6$

## Objective Fucntion
To make trade-offs between jobs, we minimize the sum of weighted
$$\min_{\sigma} \sum^{n}_{j=1}w_{j}C_{j(\sigma)} $$
- Minimization is over all $n!$ schedules in $\sigma$

## Example)
Consider the same problem that has 3 jobs with the lengths $$\mathscr{l}_{1}=1, \mathscr{l}_{2}=2, \mathscr{l}_{3}=3$$
- Assuming earlier the tasks is, the higher weight

Schedule 1 $\implies \{j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\} \implies w_{1}=3, w_{2}=2, w_{3}=1$
- $3\cdot 1+2\cdot 3+1\cdot 6=15$

Schedule 2 $\implies \{j_{1}, j_{3}, j_{2}\} \implies w_{1}=3, w_{2}=1, w_{3}=2$
- $3\cdot 1+1\cdot 3+2\cdot 6 =18$

Schedule 3 $\implies \{j_{2}, j_{1}, j_{3}\} \implies w_{1}=2, w_{2}=3, w_{3}=1$
- $2\cdot 1+3\cdot 3+1\cdot 6=17$

Schedule 4 $\implies \{j_{2}, j_{3}, j_{1}\} \implies w_{1}=1, w_{2}=3, w_{3}=2$
- $1\cdot 1+3\cdot 3+2\cdot 6=22$

Schedule 5 $\implies \{j_{3}, j_{1}, j_{2}\} \implies w_{1}=2, w_{2}=1, w_{3}=3$
- $2\cdot 1+1\cdot 3+3\cdot 6=23$

Schedule 6 $\implies \{j_{3}, j_{2}, j_{1}\} \implies w_{1}=1, w_{2}=2, w_{3}=3$
- $1\cdot 1+2\cdot 3+3\cdot 6=25$

$\{j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\}$ is the schedule that minimizes the sum of weighted completion times

## Generalization
Minimize the sum of weighted completion times

**Input)** A set of $n$ jobs with positive lengths $\mathscr{l}_{1}, \mathscr{l}_{2}, \mathscr{l}_{3}\dots\mathscr{l}_{n}$ and positive weights $w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3}\dots w_{n}$

**Output)** A job sequence that minimizes the sum of weighted completion times

**Q)** If job lengths are identical, should we schedule smaller or larger weight jobs earlier?
- Smaller
