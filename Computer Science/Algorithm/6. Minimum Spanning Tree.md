# Spanning Tree Problem
Minimum spanning tree problem is about connecting a bunch of objects as cheaply as possible
- Modeled with Graphs
	- $G(V,E)$ has two ingredients: vertices and edges
	- For this problem, we will consider only undirected graph

**Input:** Undirected graph $G(V,E)$ in which each edge $e$ has a rea;-valued cost $c_{e}$

**Output:** Compute a spanning tree of the graph with the minimum possible fum of edge costs

**Properties of Spanning Tree**
1) It should not contain a cycle
2) Should include a path between every pait of vertices

# Prim's Algorithm
1. Choose an arbitrary vertex. 
2. Observe all possible edges from the vertex in the current spanning tree
3. Choose the cheapest edge if it doesn't cause a cycle
4. Repeat this until all vertex are included

# Kruskal's Algorithm
Unlike Prim's, rather than growing a single tree from a starting vertex, it can grow multiple trees in parallel
- It will create a single tree at the end
- Can choose the cheapest edge that is not connected to the starting vertex

1. Sort the list of edges in increasing order
2. From the beginning of the list (the cheapest edge), observe an edge
3. If that does not cause cycle, then add them in the current spanning tree
4. Repeat this until all vertex are included

## Union-Find Data Structure
Kruskal's Algorithm check cycle in every iteration
- Adding an edge $(v,w)$ to $T$ creates a cycle iff $T$ already contain $v-w$ path
	- $v-w$ path does not necessarily be an one edge

To identify whether $T$ contains a path between a given pair of vertices, we utilize the Union-Find Data Structure
- Maintain a partition of the static set of objects
- In the initial partition, each object is in its own set
- Once some sets are merged, they never split

$v$ and $w$ being in the same set of the partition means that $T$ contains $v-w$ path
