# Spanning Tree Problem
Minimum spanning tree problem is about connecting a bunch of objects as cheaply as possible
- Modeled with Graphs
	- $G(V,E)$ has two ingredients: vertices and edges
	- For this problem, we will consider only undirected graph

**Input:** Undirected graph $G(V,E)$ in which each edge $e$ has a rea;-valued cost $c_{e}$

**Output:** Compute a spanning tree of the graph with the minimum possible fum of edge costs

**Properties of Spanning Tree**
1) It should not contain a cycle
2) Should include a path between every pait of vertices

# Prim's Algorithm
1. Choose an arbitrary vertex. 
2. Observe all possible edges from the endpoints
3. Choose the cheapest edge if it doesn't cause a cycle
