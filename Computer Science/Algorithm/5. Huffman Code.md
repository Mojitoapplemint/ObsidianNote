# Definitions
**Alphabet**
- $\sum$
- Is a finite non-empty set of symbols

**Binary Code**
- A sequence of bits (0s and 1s)
- Binary code for an alphabet is a way of writing each of its symbols as a distinct binary string

**Fixed-Length Binary Code**
- Each symbol uses the same number of bits to be encoded

**Variable-Length Code**
- Each symbol may use different number of bits to be encoded

# Variable-Length vs Fixed-Length
Variable-length codes can be more efficient than fixed-length *if some symbols of the alphabet occur much more frequently than others*
