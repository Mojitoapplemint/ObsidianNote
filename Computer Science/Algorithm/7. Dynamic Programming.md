# The Weighted Independent Set Problem (WIS)
Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph

The independent set of $G$ is a subst of $S\subseteq V$ of mutually non-adjacent vertices
- For all $v,w\in S$, $(v,w)\not\in E$
- Includes $\emptyset$ and singleton

**Ex)**

- 6 Independent set
	- $\emptyset$
	- 5 singletons

## Maximum Weighted Independent Set
**Input)** An undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and nonnegative weight $w_{v}$ for each vertex $v\in V$
**Output)** An independent set $S\subseteq V$ of $G$ with maximum possible sum $\displaystyle\sum_{v\in S}w_{v}$ of vertex weights
Maximum Weighted Independent Set(MWIS)
- Optimal Solution to the WIS
