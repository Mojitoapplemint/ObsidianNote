# The Weighted Independent Set Problem (WIS)
Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph

The independent set of $G$ is a subst of $S\subseteq V$ of mutually non-adjacent vertices
- For all $v,w\in S$, $(v,w)\not\in E$
- Includes $\emptyset$ and singleton

**Ex)**
![[Pasted image 20241113211121.png|150]]
- 6 Independent set
	- $\emptyset$
	- 5 singletons

## Maximum Weighted Independent Set
**Input)** An undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and nonnegative weight $w_{v}$ for each vertex $v\in V$
**Output)** An independent set $S\subseteq V$ of $G$ with maximum possible sum $\displaystyle\sum_{v\in S}w_{v}$ of vertex weights
Maximum Weighted Independent Set(MWIS)
- Optimal Solution to the WIS


# Path Graph MWIS
Let $G=(V,E)$ denote a $n$-vertex path graph with edges $(v_{1},v_{2}), (v_{2},v_{3})\dots (v_{n-1}, v_{n})$
- Each vertex have a nonnegative weight $w_{i}$
- Suppose $S$ is MWIS with total weight $W$
	- Then, $S$ either contains the final vertex $v_{n}$ or does not

i) Suppose $v_{n}\not\in S$
- Obtain the $(n-1)$-vertex path graph $G_{n-1}$ by removing $v_{n}$ and $(v_{n-1},v_{n})$ from $G_{n}$
- Then, $S$ is an independent set of $G_{n-1}$ with total weight $W$
- If $S^{*}$ is an independent set of $G_{n-1}$ with total weight $W^{*}>W$, then $S^{*}$ would also constitute an independent set of total weight $W^{*}$ in the larger graph $G$
	- This would contradict that $S$ is the optimal solution

Once you know that an MWIS excludes that last vertex, you know exactly what it looks like-an MWIS of the smaller graph $G_{n-1}$

ii) Suppose $v_{n}\in S$
- Then $v_{n-1}\not\in S$
- We can obtain $(n-2)$-vertex path graph $G_{n-2}$ from $G$ by removing $v_{n}, v_{n-1}$ and $(v_{n-2}, v_{n-1}), (v_{n-1}, v_{n})$
