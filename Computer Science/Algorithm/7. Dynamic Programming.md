# The Weighted Independent Set Problem (WIS)
Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph

The independent set of $G$ is a subst of $S\subseteq V$ of mutually non-adjacent vertices
- For all $v,w\in S$, $(v,w)\not\in E$
- Includes $\emptyset$ and singleton

**Ex)**

- 6 Independent set
	- $\emptyset$
	- 5 singletons

## Maximum Weighted Independent Set
**Input)** An undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and nonnegative weight $w_{v}$ for each vertex $v\in V$
**Output)** An independent set $S\subseteq V$ of $G$ with maximum possible sum $\displaystyle\sum_{v\in S}w_{v}$ of vertex weights
Maximum Weighted Independent Set(MWIS)
- Optimal Solution to the WIS


# Lemma: WIS Optimal Substructure
Let $S$ be an MWIS of a path graph $G$ with $n\geq{2}$ vertices
Let $G_{i}$ denote the subgraph of $G$ comprising its first $i$ vertices and $i-1$ edges

Then, $S$ is either 
- An MWIS of $G_{n-1}$
- An MWIS of $G_{n-2}$, supplemented with the final vertex of $G$, $v_{n}$

Singles out the only two possibilities of an MWIS. So Bigger one from them is the optimal solution

## Prove
Let $G=(V,E)$ denote a $n$-vertex path graph with edges $(v_{1},v_{2}), (v_{2},v_{3})\dots (v_{n-1}, v_{n})$
- Each vertex have a nonnegative weight $w_{i}$
- Suppose $S$ is MWIS with total weight $W$
	- Then, $S$ either contains the final vertex $v_{n}$ or does not

i) Suppose $v_{n}\not\in S$
- Obtain the $(n-1)$-vertex path graph $G_{n-1}$ by removing $v_{n}$ and $(v_{n-1},v_{n})$ from $G_{n}$
- Then, $S$ is an independent set of $G_{n-1}$ with total weight $W$
- If $S^{*}$ is an independent set of $G_{n-1}$ with total weight $W^{*}>W$, then $S^{*}$ would also constitute an independent set of total weight $W^{*}$ in the larger graph $G$
	- This would contradict that $S$ is the optimal solution

Once you know that an MWIS excludes that last vertex, you know exactly what it looks like-an MWIS of the smaller graph $G_{n-1}$

ii) Suppose $v_{n}\in S$
- Then $v_{n-1}\not\in S$
- We can obtain $(n-2)$-vertex path graph $G_{n-2}$ from $G$ by removing $v_{n}, v_{n-1}$ and $(v_{n-2}, v_{n-1}), (v_{n-1}, v_{n})$
	- $S$ is **not** an independent set of $G_{n-2}$ since $v_{n}\not\in G_{n-2}$ 
	- Consider $S-\{ v_{n} \}$, then it contains neither $v_{n}$ nor $v_{n-1}$
	- So, $S-\{ v_{n} \}$ can be regarded as an independent set of the smaller graph $G_{n-2}$, with total weight of $W-w_{n}$
	- That means $S-\{ v_{n} \}$ must be an MWIS of $G_{n-2}$
- Suppose that $S^{*}$ were an independent set of $G_{n-2}$ with total weight  $W^{*}>W-w_{n}$
	- Because $G_{n-2}$ does not  contain $v_{n-1}$ adding $v_{n}$ to $S^{*}$ is valid
	- Then, $W^{*}+w_{n}>W$
	- This contradicts that $S$ is the optimal solution

# WIS Recurrence
With the assumption and notation of WIS Optimal Substructure, let $W_{i}$ denote the total weight of an MWIS of $G_{i}$. Then,
$$W_{n}=\max\{W_{n-1}, W_{n-2}+w_{n}\}$$

Or more generally, for evey $i=2,3,\dots n$
$$W_{n}=\max\{W_{i-1}, W_{i-2}+w_{i}\}$$

## Pseudocode
- Input: A path graph $G$ with vertex set $\{ v_{1},v_{2}\dots v_{n} \}$ and nonnegative weight $w_{i}$ for each vertex $v_{i}$
- Output: A MWIS of $G$

**if** $n=0$ **then**
	**return** the empty set
**if** $n=1$ **then**
	**return** $\{ v_{1} \}$

**//** Recursion when $n\geq{2}$
$S_{1}:=$ recursively compute an MWIS of $G_{n-1}$
$S_{2}:=$ recursively compute an MWIS of $G_{n-2}$
**return** $S_{1}$ or $S_{2}\cup \{ v_{n} \}$, whichever has higher weight

## Running Time
Same with running time for Fibonacci Sequence
- At each level of recursion, the number of calling the algorithm gets doubled, so it grows exponentially

# Dynamic Programming Approach
So, the exponential running time of the recursive WIS algorithm is because of solving the same subproblems from scratch over and over again
- Let's store the solution of each subproblem 

Since there are total $n+1$ subgraph(including $\emptyset$), now its linear since we can solve each subproblem only once.

## Pseudocode 1: Return weight only
$A:=$ length$-(n+1)$ array  **//** Subproblem solutions
$A[0]:=0$    **//** Base case #1
$A[1]:=w_{1}$  **//** Base case #2

**for** $i=2$ to $n$ **do**
	$A[i]:=\max\{ A[i-1], A[i-2]+w_{i} \}$

**return** $A[n]$ **//** Solution to the largest subproblems

---
## Pseudocode 2: Return weight and MWIS
$A:=$ length$-(n+1)$ array  **//** Subproblem solutions
$A[0]:=0$    **//** Base case #1
$A[1]:=w_{1}$  **//** Base case #2

**for** $i=2$ to $n$ **do**
	$A[i]:=\max\{ A[i-1], A[i-2]+w_{i} \}$

**return** $A[n]$ **//** Solution to the largest subproblems

## Theorem
For every path graph and nonnegative vertex weights, the WIS algorithm runs in linear time and returns the total weight of a maximum-weight independent set.

# Dynamic Programming Paradigm
Systematically solve all the sub problems one by one, working from smallest to largest, and extract the f inal solution from those of the subproblems
1) Identify a relatively small collection of subproblems
2) Show how to quickly and correctly solve larger subproblems given the solutions to smaller ones
3) Show how to quickly and correctly infer the final solution from the solutions to all of the subproblems
