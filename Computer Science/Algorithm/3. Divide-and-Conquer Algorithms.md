# Paradigm
1. **Divide** the input into smaller subproblems
2. **Conquer** the subproblem *recusively*
3. **Combine** the solutions for the subproblems into a solution for the original probelm

## Counting Inversion
Assume that you are asked to count the number of inversions in an array
- Inversion of an array is a pair of elements that are **out of order**

$$[1,3,5,2,4,6]$$
 $\to$ $(3,2)$, $(5,2)$, $(5,4)$

```
Input: An array A of distinct Integers

Output: The number of inversions of A -the number of pairs(i,j) of array indices with i<j and A[i]>A[j] 
```

$\to$ Write down the array in order and in the given order. Connect those two one by one. Count the number of crossing pairs

 $\implies$ 3 crosses

## Worst-Case Scenario
![[Pasted image 20240920105635.png|300]]
 $\implies$ 15 crosses

If the array is in backward order, then it gives the largest number of pairs

For input size $n$
 $=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
