# Asymptotic Notation
$$\text{"Suppress Constant Factors and Lower-Order Terms"}$$
- Constant factors generally highly depend on the environment
- Lower Order terms become increasingly irrelevant as inputs is getting large
- Consider $n$ approaches infinity (When size of input is infinitely large)

$6n\log_{2}(n)+6n$
 $\implies \mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$ (Big-O Notation)

# Big-O Notation ($\leq$)
$T(n)=\mathcal{O}(f(n))$ iff there exist positive constant $c$ and $n_{0}$ such that 
$$T(n)\leq  c\cdot f(n)$$ for all $n\geq n_{0}$
- There is function $T(n)$, defined on the positive integers
- It will denote a bound on the worst-case running time of an algorithm as a function of input size $n$
- $T(n)=\mathcal{O}(f(n))$ iff $T(n)$ is eventually **bounded above** by a constant multiple of $f(n)$
	- No matter how big $n_{0}$ is since asymptotic will anyway consider even larger state

## Little-O Notation
$T(n)=o(f(n))$ iff **for every positive constant** $c$, there exists a choice of $n_{0}$ such that 
$$T(n)\leq  c\cdot f(n)$$ for all $n\geq n_{0}$

## Example 1
Show that for 
$$T(n)=a_{k}n^{k}+a_{k-1}n^{k-1}\dots a_{1}n+a_{0}$$
where $k\geq 0$ is a nonnegative integer and $a_{i}'s$ are real numbers,
$$T(n)=\mathcal{O}(n^{k})$$
**Proof)**
Claim
- $n_{0}=1$
- $c=|a_{k}|+|a_{k-1}|\dots|a_{1}|+|a_{0}|$

Now, we need to prove: For $n\geq n_{0}=1$, $T(n)\leq c\cdot n^{k}$

1. For all $a_{i}'s$ since they are real numbers, $a_{i}\leq|a_{i}|$. Therefore,
$$T(n)\leq  |a_{k}|n^{k}+|a_{k-1}|n^{k-1}\dots |a_{1}|n+|a_{0}|$$

2. For all $n$ and $k$, since they are positive, $n^{k-1}, n^{k-2}\dots n, n^{0}\leq n^{k}$
$$\leq  |a_{k}|n^{k}+|a_{k-1}|n^{k}\dots |a_{1}|n^{k}+|a_{0}|n^{k}$$
$$=(|a_{k}|+|a_{k-1}|\dots|a_{1}|+|a_{0}|)n^{k}$$
$$=c\cdot n^{k}$$
Since this holds for every $n\geq n_{0}$, $T(n)=\mathcal{O}(n^{k})$

## Example 2
Let $k\geq 1$ be a positive integer and define $T(n)=n^{k}$. Show that $T(n)$ is not $\mathcal{O}(n^{k-1})$

**Proof)**
Proof by contradiction: Suppose $T(n) = \mathcal{O}(n^{k-1})$.

Then, there is some constant $c$ and $n_{0}$ that satisfies
$$n^{k}\leq  c\cdot n^{k-1}$$
for all $n>n_{0}$

Since $n>0$, we can divide $n^{k-1}$ to both side
$$n\leq  c$$

Consider that $n$ is variable and $c$ is just an constant. There is no such constant $c$ that greater than every positive integer.
- There is a contradiction, thus the initial assumption was wrong
- Therefore, $T(n)$ is not $\mathcal{O}(n^{k-1})$

# Big-Omega Notation ($\geq$)
$T(n)=\Omega(f(n))$ iff there exist positive constants $c$ and $n_{0}$ such that
$$T(n)\geq  c\cdot f(n)$$ for all $n\geq n_{0}$
- $T(n)$ is big-omega of $f(n)$ iff $T(n)$ is eventually **bounded below** by a constant multiple of $f(n)$

# Big-Theta Notation (=)
$T(n)=\Theta(f(n))$ iff there exist positive constants $c_{1}$, $c_{2}$ and $n_{0}$ such that
$$c_{1}\cdot f(n)\leq  T(n)\leq  c_{2}\cdot f(n)$$ for all $n\geq n_{0}$
- $T(n)$ is eventually **sandwiched** between two different constant multiples of $f(n)$
	- $T(n)=\Theta(n)$ iff $T(n)=\mathcal{O}(n)$ and $T(n)=\Omega(n)$


# Example
Let $T(n)=\frac{1}{2}n^{2}+3n$. Evaluate the validity of each statements

1) $T(n)=\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- **False:** $T(n)$ is quadratic. The linear term does not matter for big $n$

2) $T(n)=\Omega(n)$
	- **True:** $n$ is lower order than $n^{2}$, thus it will be a lower bound

3) $T(n)=\Theta(n^{2})$
	- **True:** Let $c_{1}=\frac{1}{3}, c_{2}=1,n_{0}=6$
$$\frac{1}{3}n^{2}<\frac{1}{2}n^{2}+3n<n^{2}\text{ for all }n>n_{0}$$
4) $T(n)=\mathcal{O}(n^{3})$
	- **True:** Since $n^{3}$ is higher order, it will be upper bound


Note that for 2) and 4), they are the true statements, but $f(n)'s$ themselves *are not the best answer*
- If we are supposed to calculate for $f(n)$, then we must give $n^{2}$
