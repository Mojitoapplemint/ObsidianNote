# What is Algorithm?
Set of **well-defined** rules for solving computational problems
- Well-defined means you can't bend or change it
- Consist of basic operations: Addition and Simple Multiplication(between two 1digit numbers)

# 3 Principles for the Analysis of Algorithm
## Worst-Case Analysis
The performance of the algorithm varies depend on how good the input is

## Big-Picture Analysis


## Asymptotic Analysis
