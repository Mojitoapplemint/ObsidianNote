# Joint Policy and Expected Return
Let $\hat{h}^{t}=\{ (s^{\mathcal{T}}, o^{\mathcal{T}}, a^{\mathcal{T}})_{\mathcal{T}=0}^{t-1}, s^{t},o^{t} \}=\{ s^{0}, o^{0}, a^{0}, \dots a^{t-1}, s^{t}, o^{t}\}$ be a **full history** up to time $t$,  consisting of the states, joint obesrvations, and joint actions of all agents in each time step before $t$, and $s^{t}$, $o^{t}$.






A solution to a game is a joint policy, $\pi=(\pi_{1}\dots \pi_{n})$, which satisfies certain requirements defined by the solution concept in terms of the expected return $U_{i}(\pi)$
