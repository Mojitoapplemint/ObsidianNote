# Normal-Form Games
Defines a single interaction between two or more agents

A normal-form game consists of
- Finite set of agents: $I=\{ 1,2,\dots n \}$
- For each agent $i\in I$ :
	- Finite set of action $A_{i}$
	- Reward function $\mathcal{R_{i}}:A\to\mathbb{R}$ where $A=A_{1}\times A_{2}\dots \times A_{n}$

## Procedure
1. Each agent $i\in I$ selects a policy $\pi_{i}:A_{i}\to[0,1]$
	- Policy assigns probability to the actions available to the agent
	- $\sum_{a_{i}\in A_{i}}\pi_{i}(a_{i})=1$
	- 
2. The resulting actions of all agents form a joint policy $a=(a_{1},a_{2}\dots a_{n})$
3. Each agent receives a reward based on its reward function and the joint action, $r_{i}=\mathcal{R}_{i}(a)$

## Classification
Zero-sum game: The sum of the agents' rewards is always 0
- If someone get positive reward, then someone gets negative
- $\sum_{i\in I}\mathcal{R}_{i}(a)=0$

Common-reward game: All agents receive the same reward
- $\forall \text{ }i,j\in I,\quad \mathcal{R}_{i}=\mathcal{R}_{j}$

Matrix game: Normal-form game with two agents
- In this case, the reward function can be compactly represented as matrix

General game: No restriction
