# What DL is Good For
1. Problems with long lists of rules: When 
	- When the traditional approach fails
2. Continually changing environment
	- DL can adapt to new scenario
3. Discovering insights within collections of data

# What DL is not Good For
1. When you need explainability
2. When traditional approach is a better option
3. When errors are unacceptable
4. There is not enough data

# ML vs DL
- DL performs better in unstructured data(webpage, pictures) while ML performs better in structured data(csv, excel)

| Structured Data        | Unstructured Data               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Random Forest          | Neural Networks                 |
| Naive Bayes            | Fully Connected Neural Networks |
| Nearest Neighbor       | Convolutional Neural Networks   |
| Support Vector Machine | Recurrent Neural Network        |

# Neural Networks
![[Pasted image 20240503015926.png]]

Take inputs -> Convert them into numbers -> Find patterns -> Generate output in numbers -> Converted it into real world output

## Anatomy of Neural Networks

## Types of Learning
### Supervised Learning
- Have Data and Labels associated with the data
- Ex) Pictures of food and the correct name of each food photo

### Semi-Supervised Learning
- Have only some labels
- Establish Neural Networks with labeled data and try to label unlabeled data

### Unsupervised Learning
- Have only data, without label

### Transfer Learning
- Utilize other deep learning model in different problem(set of data)
