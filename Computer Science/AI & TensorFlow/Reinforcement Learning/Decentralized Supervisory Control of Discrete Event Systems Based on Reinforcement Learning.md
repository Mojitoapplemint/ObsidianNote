# Introduction
A Controller called a super visor assigns control patterns to the Discrete Event System(DES)
- DES: set of events permitted to occur at the current state of the DES

Because of inherent restrictions of the systems or controllers, many DESs are often controlled in a decentralized manner where local supervisors assign control patterns based on their local observations.

# Decentralized Control method based on RL
In the proposed method, supervisors exist locally and control the DES jointly without direct negotiation between the supervisors. Each supervisor obtains a control pattern through learning without knowl edge of detailed specifications and precise costs in the de centralized DES.
