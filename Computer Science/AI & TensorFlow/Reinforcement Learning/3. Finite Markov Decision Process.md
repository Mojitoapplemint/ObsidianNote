Classical formalization of sequential decision making, where actions influence not just immediate rewards, but also subsequent situations, or states, and through those future rewards
- Involve delayed reward and need to tradeoff immediate and delayed reward
- Estimate the value $q_{*}(s,a)$ of each action a in each state $s$, or we estimate the value $v_{*}(s)$ of each state given optimal action selections
