Q-Learning is a type of RL
- Involves and AI agent operating in an environment with states & rewards (inputs) and actions (outputs)
- Involves **model-free** environments
	- The AI agents is not seeking to learn about an underlying mathematical model probability distribution
	- Instead, the AI agent attemps to construct an optimal policy directly by interacting with the environment
- Trial and Error based approach
	- The agent repeatedly tries to solve the problem using varied approaches, and continuously updates its policy as it learns more and ore about it environment

# Characteristic
Fundamental RL characteristic also apply to QL

Additional Features
- The number of possible states is finite
	- The agent will always be in one of a fixed number of possible situations
- The number of possible actions is finite
	- The agent will always need to choose from among a fixed number of possible actions
