Describe how different outcomes are related to each other

The probability of measuring any one particular number is always 0
- i.e. For probability function $P(X)$, where $X$ is continuous, then the probability that $X=y$ is $P(X=y)=0$, no matter what $y$ is
- The probability that something on a continuum happening **exactly** is zero, but the probability of something happening **near** any given number is not necessarily zero

## Properties
1. $0\leq P(x) \leq 1$ for any $x$
2. The probability that something happens is 1(Something must happen)

# Probability Density Function
- Does not give us the probability, but instead when compared to another event gives how much more or less probable even $Y$ is than $X$

The probability of a continuous random variable with probability density function$P_{D}(x)$ taking on a value between $a$ and $b$ is given by
$$p=\int^{b}_{a}P_{D}(x) d{x} $$
## Cumulative probability function
$$C(y)=\int^{y}_{-\infty}P_{D}(x) d{x}$$

# Normal
[[5. Normal Distribution]]
$$N(x;\mu,\sigma)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{ 2\pi }}e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}$$

# Gamma
$$G(x;\theta, k)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(k)\theta^{k}}x^{k-1}e^{\frac{-x}{\theta}}$$
- Mean: $\mu_{gamma}=k\theta$
- Median: N/A
- Mode: $(k-1)\theta$
- Std. Dev: $\sigma_{gamma}=\theta\sqrt{ k }$

Can model the probability of $N$ things occurring per unit time
- Can model the time to the next event
- It allows for asymmetry in a value
- Values must be between 0 and $\infty$ (Cannot handle negative numbers)

Where $\theta>0$ and $k>0$ are called scale and shape parameter
- If $k\in\mathbb{Z}$, the Gamma distribution is often called the **Erlang Distribution** 

$\Gamma(k)$ is called the gamma function
- $\theta=\frac{1}{2}$ and $2k=\kappa$, then Gamma distribution is called **Chi-squared Distribution** with parameter $\kappa$

## Scott's Rule
Optimal bin width
$$h=\frac{3.49s}{^{3}\sqrt{ n }}$$
- $s$ is the sample std. dev
- $n$ is the number of data points

# Beta Distribution
- Has a relationship to the [[Binomial Distribution|Binomial Distribution]]
- Used for events that happen on a limited space
	- On the interval $[0,1]$
$$\beta(x;a,b)=\frac{x^{a-1}(1-x)^{b-1}}{B(a,b)}$$
- Mean: $\mu_{beta}=\frac{a}{a+b}$
- Median: $\frac{a-\frac{1}{3}}{a+b-\frac{2}{3}} \text{ (a,b>1)}$
- Mode: $\frac{a-1}{a+b-2}\text{ (a,b>1)}$
- Std. Dev: $\frac{1}{a+b}\sqrt{ \frac{ab}{a+b+1} }$

Primary component of subjective logic
- Truth is not binary but exists on a spectrum from completely false
