Population
- Every person/things that satisfies a set of criteria

Sample
- A selection from the population
- Can be **biased**
	- Might change the context of our data which can lead to bad generalization
- Still necessary if the *entire population is too large to measure*
- **Bigger and more random** the sample, better your approximation 
	- Be careful not to choose the same data many times

# Formulas
- Formula of [[3. Spread and Variance#Variance|variance]] changes depends on whether on sample or population 

Population Variance
$$V_{p} = \sigma^{2}= \sum^{N}_{{i=1}}{(X_{i}-\mu)^{2}} \div N$$
Sample Variance
$$V_{s} = s^{2}= \sum^{N}_{{i=1}}{(X_{i}-\mu)^{2}} \div (N-1)$$

## In Python
- In python, population [[3. Spread and Variance#Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] is default
- Sample std. dev: `np.std(COLUMN_OF_DATA, ddof=1)`
- When $N$ is very large, the difference between two formulas is negligeble
