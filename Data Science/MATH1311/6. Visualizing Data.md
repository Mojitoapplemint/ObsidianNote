# Bad Graph
Some graph exaggerate the visual result to fool people
1. Changing the scale of the axis might exaggerate the result
	- Scale not starting from 0 
		- ![[Pasted image 20240126134344.png]]
	- Length of interval is different but visualize as they are same
2. Using more than two axis
3. Not providing axis and create their own graph
	- ![[Pasted image 20240126140130.png]] The graph is actually linear, not exponential

# Six Rules of Thumb
1. Thick lines are better lines
2. Fonts should be approximately 2 points bigger than the text surrounding the graph
3. Colour-blinded friendly colour palettes
	- Avoid Red-Green combination
4. Colour should have a specific purpose, meaning, information
5. Label Everything: Axis, Name of each Data
6. Use 2D plot(Avoid 3D or Round)

# Scatter Plot
- Suite when comparing two columns of data to one another
- Two columns are paired as $(x,y)$
- See possible relationships between the columns
- `sns.scatterplot(x="COLUMN_1", y="COLUMN_2")`

## Relationships between data
![[Pasted image 20240129140202.png|500]]
1. No relations
	- More like a noise
2. Positive correlation
	- Two data are proportional
3. Negative correlation
	- Two data are inversely proportional 

## Correlation vs Causation
- Just because two pieces of data are correlated, does not mean that one is *causing the other*

# Pattern Recognition
- Most scientific research, people tend to define **linear relationship** between two variable
	- Because we can define reasonable linear relationships with a *smaller sample size* than non linear relationship
	- Non-linear relationship requires much more data
- Using only few data might not enough to recognise the pattern
	- Sample size should be large
- Every relationships can be mathematically written as 
$$Y(X) = a_{0}+a_{1}X+a_{2}X^{2}+a_{3}X^{3}\dots$$

## How many points are enough?
- If we have a Strong Theoretical Underpinning, you can get by with less data

## Scatter plot Outliers
 - Data points that are *extremely far* from the general trend of the data
 - May Represent 
	1. Rare occurrence or event
	2. Error
	3. Not rare data nor error, but out of context
 - Can significantly affect our analysis
	 - Arithmetic mean is sensitive
	 - However, never remove the data from the raw data, but wish to filter when analyzing

# Histogram

Interpretation
- Gives us how our data is distributed
- Mode & Standard Deviation are directly visible
- Provides qualitative idea about spread(General Shape)
- If the data set is sample, then histogram can *generalizes of shape of population*

- Look down of data and count the number of times a **specific category appears** in a categorical variable
 - Values are typically [[2. Central Tendency#Binning|binned]] and each bar represent number of data in each bin
 - We can use histogram to find the probability of each category

## In python
- `sns.histoplot(x=data['state'])`
- `sns.histoplot(x=data['state'], stat='probability')`
	- Change y-axis to probability
- `sns.histoplot(x=data['state'], stat='density')`
	- For [[1. Types of Data#Continuous Data|Continuous Data]]
	- Probability of continuous data is the **area of the bar**
- `sns.histoplot(x=data['state'], stat='probability', discrete=True)`
	- For [[1. Types of Data#Discrete Data|Discrete Data]]
- Options: `[layered(Default), dodge, stack, fill]`

### Setting Bin Width
- Setting Bin width
	- `sns.histoplot(x=data['state'], binwidth=(int))`
- Setting Bin num
	- `sns.histoplot(x=data['state'], bin=(int))`

# Bar graph
- Used to compare a single **summary statistic** across multiple categories
- Compare CT across different categories
- Require y-axis

## Confidential interval
- A range of parameter or statistics that quantifies out certainty in out estimate
- The $M\%$ confidence interval is an interval within which we expect $M\%$  of new measurements of parameter statistic to fall
	- Usually $95\%$

## In python
- `sns.barplot(x=data[], y=data[])`
	- Bar plot will compute the arithmetic mean per x-category of the numerical column given for y
	- The black line show the confidence interval
- Change confidential interval
	- `sns.barplot(x=data[], y=data[], errorbar='sd')`
- Change measure of CT
	- `sns.barplot(x=data[], y=data[], estimator=(method for other CT))`
