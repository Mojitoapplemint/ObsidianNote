- Unimodal: Have one peak
- Bimodal: Have two peak
- Trimodal, tetradomal, and so on...

# Variance
![[Pasted image 20240117154706.png|400]]

- How spread out the data is around the mean
- High variance means the *larger the range* of typical values we should expect
- If the variance is exactly 0, then every single data is identical to the mean
- Calculate by adding up all the distance from the mean to each data point
	- We need to convert all distance value to positive
	- By squaring the distance before adding up
$$V_{p} = \sigma^{2}= \sum^{N}_{{i=1}}{(X_{i}-\mu)^{2}} \div N$$
- Note that variance can be interpret as *the average* of all squares of the distance between the data and the mean

$\to$ *Why square, not Absolute Value?*
- Come from normal distribution
- Geometric distance is generally pythagorean theorem
- Further mathematic(eg. differential) is easier to do with squares more than abs
- `(Standard Deviation)**2`

## Standard Deviation
- Since we are squaring the distance, its **unit is different** from the original data
	- Thus, they can't be compared
- Thus, we are taking square root
	- It's called **standard deviation**
- `np.std(Column_data)`
