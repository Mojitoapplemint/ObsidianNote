# Representing Data
## Tabular
Data represented in table
- Column: A different attribute of a single entity
- Row: Different/Independent Entity

Mathematic Notation
- Write column as **letter**, and row as **subscript**
- $x_{i}$
	- `x` is column and `i` is row

In `python`, we imports `pandas` library to represent table
	- Table in `python` is called **dataframe**
	- Columns are **named**, rows are **numbered**

# Type of Data
![[Pasted image 20240110133847.png|400]]

## Qualitative
- Makes up most of data in the world
- data that is **not amenable** to mathematical operation 
- Example
	 - Hair color
	 - Letter grades
	 - Brands
	 - etc
- Can be either ordered(Ordinal) or unordered(Nominal)

### Nominal(Unordered) Data
- Breaks things down into categories that cannot be ordered
	- There is no natural way to put one before another
- Examples
	- Colours/Things
	- Material Type
	- etc

$\rightarrow$ Alphabetic order??
- Alphabetical ordering is not a natural ordering, but *arbitrary ordering*
- Can be create issues of interpretation and can then allow you to say things that are technically true, but not actually tyrue
- Try to ask **"Is one greater than the other?"**

### Ordinal(Ordered) Data
- Data that can be naturally ordered 
	- A natural ordering is one that is **universally agreed** upon and is relevant
- It can usually **be mapped** to the numbers (0,1,2,3...)
- Examples
	- Store rating
	- Pain scale
	- Dates
	- Letter grade

$\to$ Even if the rating system use number, it's not quantitative because we do not operate mathematical operation in store rating, we just use number for notation not due to numerical value

## Quantitative(Numerical)
- Data that can be mathematically manipulated in a meaningful way
	- See numbers and behave like numbers

Numbers that are and aren't numerical
![[Pasted image 20240206152125.png|400]]
- Standings are numbers, but they're arbitrary
- Mathematical operation doesn't give any meaningful result

- Basket can provide meaningful information by mathematical operation
	- **Divide** basket into number of game and get average basket per each game

### Discrete Data
- The values cannot be subdivide below a certain limit and still make sense
- "There are *25.5 people* eating at Gracie's per day"
	- We can't have 25.5 people
- If there is gaps on the number line that are **impossible given the context**
- In math, we say it is **countable or can be mapped to the natural numbers**

### Continuous Data
- Numerical data that is not discrete
- If **any** number in a range is theoretically possible, given the constraints of the data
	- Usually, if you see decimals, treat the data as continuous
