Let there are two events, $P$ and $Q$

**Example Scenario**
$A$ is suspected to be infected, so $A$ is taking the test

# True Positive
- Should be True, and it is true
- Both $P$ and $Q$ are true

**Ex)** $A$ is infected, and the test is positive

# True Negative
- Should be false, and it is false
- Both $P$ and $Q$ are false

**Ex)** $A$ is not infected, and the test is negative

# False Positive
- Should be False, but result is True
- Result is true, but the hypothesis is false
- **Complement of True Negative**

**Ex)** $A$ is not infected, but the result is true

# False Negative
- Should be True, but the result is false
- Result is false, but the hypothesis is true
- **Complement of True Positive**

**Ex)** $A$ is infected, but the result is negative
