The most common "Shape" of data is **normally-distributed data**

# Three vital properties
1. It is symmetric
2. It is unimodal: Have *one mountain*
3. Empirical Rule

## Empirical Rule
The only clue to whether something can be treated as normally distributed or not

![[Pasted image 20240124134141.png|400]]
- **68%** of all data points fall within 1 std.dev of the mean
	- $[\mu-\sigma, \mu+\sigma]$
- **95%** of all data points fall within 2 std.dev of the mean
	- $[\mu-2\sigma, \mu+2\sigma]$
- **99.7%** of all data points fall within 3 std.dev of the mean
	- $[\mu-3\sigma, \mu+3\sigma]$
- 0.03% of data is fall off

### In python
Can use `(data).loc[(put interval here)]` to find the number of data within [[3. Spread and Variance#Standard Deviation|std.dev.]]
```python
points_in_1_std = data.loc[(data['COLUMN_NAME']>mean-std) & (data['COLUMN_NAME']<mean+std)]

std_1 = len(points_in_1_std)

emp_rule_1 = std_1/len(data)*100 # expressing in percentage
```

## Judging Normal Distribution
- Almost never going to see perfect normal distribution
	- Judging whether data is normally distributed is *really depends*
	- Have to think of the context and other attributes of data set
	- If it fails conceivably *at least* one interval, then it is not normal distribution

# Central Limit Theorem
- The distribution of *sample means* approximates a normal distribution as the [[4. Sample and Population|sample]] size gets larger, regardless of the [[4. Sample and Population|population]]'s distribution
