# Measures of Central Tendency(The Big Three)

Usually use for dependent variable
- If the column are independent of influence, i.e. if it is a cause not an effect, we are not taking central tendency
- *"What value would I be most likely to get if I picked at random from the set"*
- Heavily depends on the **type of data** and the way **it's distributed**

## Mode
- The value which **appears most frequently** in the sample
	- Having multiples modes is possible
- Applicable for all types of data

For continuous data?
- Discretize the data by binning it, such as group similar values into **interval**
- *Modal class* is one of the interval that has the most entry

### Binning
$$Binsize = \frac{MaxValue - MinValue}{NumBin}$$
- Define a number of bin 
$Bin1 = (Min-1, Min+BinSize)$
$Bin2 = (Min+BinSize, Min+2\cdot BinSize)$
...
$Bin N = (Min+(n-1)\cdot BinSize, Max+1)$

### Crude Mode
- Central value(Arithmetic mean) of modal class
$$M_{0} =\frac{m+M}{2}$$
where
- $m$ is lower bound of modal class
- $M$ is upper bound of modal class

### Mode for grouped continuous data
$$M_{0}= L+\frac{f_{1}-f_{0}}{2f_{1}-f_{0}-f_{2}}w$$
where
- $L$ is lower bound of modal class
- $f_{1}$ is the count of the modal class
- $f_{0}$ is the count of the class before modal class
	- Zero if modal class is the first class
- $f_{2}$ is the count of the class after modal class
	- Zero if modal class is the last class
- $w$ is the width of the classes(BinSize)

### Python
`(vairable of column).mode()`
- Pandas mode automatically discards cells that do not have a value in them
- This can lead to invalid mode
- `(vairable of column).mode(dropna = False)`: Considering **"no data" is data**: Python return **nan**(Not a Number) if mode is empty cell

`.dropna()`
- Drops all rows that doesn't have any data in it
- `dropna(subset = ['ColumnName'])`: Only checks that column

$\rightarrow$ *Again, Be careful when removing a data*

## Median
- Middle value when the data is ordered smallest to largest
	- Write repeated value as many times as it appears
- There are two median values of there are even number of data
	- Take arithmetic mean of two
- Not affected by outliers
- Not working for **Nominal Data**

## Mean
- Also called **Average value**, expected value
	- Measures what we typically should expect to see if we observe our data randomly
- Cannot be used on nominal data, and has limited use on ordinal data

### The arithmetic Mean
- AKA expected value
- Sensitive to [[6. Visualizing Data#Scatter plot Outliers|outliers]]
- (sum of all data)/(#data)
$$m_{A} = \sum^N_{i=1}x_{i}\div N$$
- `np.mean()`

### Geometric Mean
- Better suited to data that is multiplicative in nature 
$$m_{G} = (\Pi^N_{i=1}x_{i})^{\frac{1}{n}}$$
- Cannot be used if there is 0 in data
- Suitable if data has value at various magnitude
- Examples
	- Finance
	- Geometry
	- Population growth calculation
- `stats.gmean()`

Ex) Average rate of change in percentage per unit time through a certain period of time 

### Harmonic Mean
- Basically only used for speeds and other **rates**
$$m_{H} = N \div \sum^N_{i=1}\frac{1}{x_{i}}$$
- Cannot be used if there is 0 in data
- `stats.hmean()`

### When to use each mean
| Arithmetic                    | Geometric                      | Harmonic |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| When it doubt                 | Data has very different scales | Data is made of rates         |
| Large Dataset                 | Averaging ratios                               | Data has no zeros         |
| The values are independent    | Data is dependent                               |          |
| Values are in a similar range | Data has different units                               |          |
| There are not many outliers   | Data is multiplicative                               |          |
| There are zeros               |                                |          |
| Additive data                 |                                |          |

- If none of them are applicable, then you might have to go back to more fundamental principal to calculate the average
	- Calculating average speed(which is rate) that contains 0 as one of the date
	- You are going back to $v=\frac{d}{t}$ formula

### Changing/Removing Data
- Should be clear about what was removed and why it was removed
- Should be removed from personal analysis but never from your raw data
	- `.csv` file should never be manipulated

## Mode vs Median vs Mean
Determined based on the [[3. Spread and Variance#Type of spread|Spread]]

Mean
- Most tractable
- For `Symmetrical` and `Unimodal` data

Median
- 
- For `Asymmetrical` and `Unimodal` data

Mode
- For `nominal` and `Bimodal(& trimodal...)` data
