$$\text{(Probability)}= \frac{\text{(Num of times a desired outcome can occur)}}{\text{(Num of all possible outcome)}}$$
# Fundamental Principle of Counting
If there are two separate cases and number of possible outcomes for each case are $m,n$ then total number of possible outcome is $m\cdot n$

# Counting without Replacement
One condition of permutations and combinations is that the objects *cannot be repeated*
- This is called counting without replacement
- Once one object is picked, then it cannot be picked again

# Permutation
Probability when Objects cannot be repeated + **Order matters**
- `A -> B -> C` $\neq$ `B -> A -> C`
$$_{n}P_{r}=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$
- Denote as `"n picks r"`

## Permutation with replacement
- What if we could select the same thing multiple time, but order still matters?
$$_{n}PR_{r}=n^{r}$$

# Combination
 Probability when Objects cannot be repeated + **Order doesn't matter**
$$_{n}C_{r}=\frac{_{n}P_{r}}{r!}=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!\cdot r!}$$
- For any set of $r$ picked objects from $_{n}P_{r}$, there will be $r!$ amount of set that choose the same objects, but different order, thus we divide it
- Denote as `"n choose r"`

## Permutation with replacement
- What if we could select the same thing multiple time, and order doesn't matters?
$$_{n}CR_{r}=\text{ } _{n+r-1}C_{r}$$

# Sample Space
- Set of all possible outcomes
	- Space of all possible events
- Denote as $\Omega$
- Two properties
	1. **Exhaustive**. It accounts for every possibility
	2. The things in it are **mutually exclusive**. If one outcome happen, this necessarily means every other outcome didn't happen

## Example
Sample set of all outcomes or rolling two 6-sided dice is written as
$$\Omega=\{(d_{1},d_{2})|1\leq d_{1},d_{2} \leq 6\}$$

# Events
- Outcome will be called Event
- Use set notation: `{}`
$$A=\{\text{values involved | conditions that needs to be met}\}$$
- And the "probability of $A$" is written as
$$P(A)=\frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$$
- `| |` notation represents the cardinality, which is basically # of outcome
- $0\leq P(A) \leq 1$

- What counts as an event, and which events go into your sample space depends on the context that you are working in
	- Events and sample space is *context dependent*

## Example
The event all outcomes of rolling two 6-sided dice where the sum is 7
$$A=\{(d_{1},d_{2})|d_{1}+d_{2}=7\}$$
- This gives all pairs from $\Omega$ where the pair of numbers sum to 7

# Van Diagram
- Sample Space $\Omega$ is represented by some shape(usually rectangle)
- All events are included within our sample space (in the abstract sense, with arbitrary shape)

# Logical Expression
## And
- $A$ **and** $B$
- Use intersection symbol
- Axiomatic: Self-evident or assumed to be true
$$A\cap B$$
$$P(A\cap B)=P(B\cap A)$$

## Or
- $A$ **or** $B$
- Use union symbol
$$A\cup B$$
$$P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$
![[Pasted image 20240214141604.png|300]]

## Complement
- Not $A$
$$A^{C}\text{ / }\neg A$$
![[Pasted image 20240214141731.png|300]]

# Mutually Exclusive
- If A happens, B cannot happen and vice versa
$$A\cap B=\emptyset \text{, } P(A \cap B)=0$$

# Independence
- Event $A$ happening doesn't affect the probability $B$ happening
- By Fundamental Principle of Counting:
$$P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)$$
 - If this is not true, then they are not independent

# Birthday Paradox
- What is the probability that at least two people in this room having the same birth?
	- $N$ people, 365 days in a year, 

$\Omega=\{b_{1}, b_{2},\dots b_{n}|b_{i}\text{ is a day of the year }\}$

- The first person can have a birthday on any possible day, so can second and third person, etc
- This is a permutation with replacement(all birthday are independent)
$$PR_{N}=365^{N}$$

## Negation
- The question of what is probability that **at least** two people in this room share birthday
	- We have to look at two people are sharing, three people are sharing...
- Instead, we are using negation
	- What is the probability that everyone in the room has a unique birthday?

- Permutation without replacement

$A^{C}=\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \dots b_{n} | bi\neq b_{j}\text{ if }i\neq j\}$
$$|A^{c}|=_{365}P_{N}$$
$$P(A^{c})=\frac{_{365}P_{N}}{365^{N}}$$

- if we subtract from 1, we will get the probability that at least two people are sharing the birthday

$$P(A)=1-P(A^{c})=1-\frac{_{365}P_{N}}{365^{N}}$$
