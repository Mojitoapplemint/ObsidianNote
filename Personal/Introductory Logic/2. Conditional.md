Statement
- Sentence(or part of a sentence) that expresses something true or false
- Can be built out of more than one statement
	- Check whether the entire sentence is still a statement even if one part is removed
	- Ex) "Roses need water and roses are living things"

# Logical Operation
## And( $\wedge$ , &)
True if both p and q are true, unless it’s false or unknown (True & Unknown) 

## Or( $\lor$ )
True at least one of them are true.

“$p\text{ XOR } q$ / $p\oplus q$"
- Only true if one of them is true, not both

## Implication( $p\longrightarrow q$  / $p\implies q$)
“$\text{if }p\text{, then }q$" : ( $p\longrightarrow q$ )
“$p\text{ implies }q$” : ( $p\implies q$ )
- **True if whenever p is true, q is also true **
- To show an implication is false, find counter example(p is true, but q is false)
- *The only case it’s false if p is true, but q is false *

**Note)**
If $p$ is always false, then we take "$p\longrightarrow q$" to *be true*, regardless $q$ is true or false 
- If 0=1, then 1+1=5 : is considered as true 

## If and only if ( $p\longleftrightarrow q$ / $p\iff q$ / $p\text{ iff }q$)
- True if whenever p is true, q is true, and whenever q is true, then p is true 
- Original statement and its converse are both true 

## Not P ( $\lnot p$ ): It is not the case that~
true if p is false, and false if p is true 

# Conditional Statements
Capture the notion of "following from"
- "If, then": (Antecedent) $\to$ (Consequent)
- Only false if antecedent is true and consequent is false

But not just "if, then" statement
- Had he made the catch, they would have been out of the inning
- His having made the catch implies they'd be out the inning
- Provided he makes the catch, they're out of the inning
- They're out of the inning, provided he makes the catch

## Complex Conditional
1. Symbolize the Component Statement
2. Put all the conditional sin their standard "If C, then O form"
	- Note that "so long as" works as "if"
3. Symbolize the conditionals *from the innermost* ones outwards

### Innermost
"If I go to the store, then (if I buy chips then I will eat a bag of chips)"
- First "If" implies the entire another conditional 
	- Conditional in another conditional is called, inner conditional
- $S\to C\implies S\to(B\to E)$

## Metaphysical Argument
One way of thinking of properties, is that properties cohere is things


## Standard Argument
$$
\small
\begin{array} \\
\text{1. Modus Ponens} & \text{2. Modus Tollens} & \text{3. Disjuctive Syllogism} & \text{4. Chain Rule} & \text{5. Resolution}  \\
p\longrightarrow q & p\longrightarrow q & p\lor q & p\longrightarrow q & p \lor r \\
p & \lnot q & \lnot p & q\longrightarrow r & q \lor \lnot r  \\
 \\
\hline
q & \lnot p & q & p \longrightarrow r & p \lor q
\end{array}
$$

- For Chain Rule, it doesn't means that combining premises are not equivalent to the conclusion
